  description: Steady flow with River boundary condition
  #      * The test problem use square computational domain and emulate slope of the top surface
  #      * by prescribing boundary (hD) and switch pressure (hS) as linear functions, while
  #      * hD > hS to get physically relevant solution (no outflow for h<hS).
  #      * The solution can be visualized with Paraview using ref_output/flow_river_square.pvsm.
  #      * The "plot over line" near the top surface clearly displays three different parts of the
  #      * top boundary. On the left where h<hS, the slope of the solution is smaller due to the limited
  #      * inflow, for h>hS to slope is higher. For h>hD, the inflow turns into outflow which is visible on
  #      * the velocity field on the left.
