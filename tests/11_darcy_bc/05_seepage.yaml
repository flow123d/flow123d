  description: Steady flow with Seepage face boundary condition
  #      * The test problem use square computational domain and emulate slope of the top surface
  #      * by prescribing the switch pressure (hS) as a linear function.
  #      * The output could be visualized with Paraview using ref_output/flow_seepage.pvsm.
  #      * According to the internal output, the interface between h<hS and h:hS should be
  #      * just in the middle. However since we can not display values on the boundary yet, the
  #      * velocities in the elements (z component in the left view) seem to have negative Z component
  #      * even on the right half of the domain so the switch point seems to be slightly on the right.
  #      * On the other hand the "plot over line" of the pressure and the switch pressure near the boundary
  #      * clearly displays the switch point in for x:0.5. Again the pressure is slightly above the switch pressure
  #      * since we do not plot values directly on the boundary.
