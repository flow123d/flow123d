  description: Simple noncompatible 3d-2d interaction.
  # Geometry : 3d rectangular, split by a fracture.
  # Prescribed constant (zero) pressure on faces parallel to fracture and given source F on the fracture.
  # For given 3d conductivity C and 2d-3d transition coef. S we have:
  # 3d pressure at fracture: P1 = F/2/C  ( = 4)
  # 2d pressure on fracture: P2 = F/2/C + F/8  ( = 7 )
  # Wrong balance data?
