# Test goal: Native output of DG transport concentration
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference: qualitative
#   - 2D DG transport on square with 4 regions with highly different conductivity
#   - concentration transport governed only by advection and boundary condition
#   - see the test 42_square4x_DG_native_write.yaml
#   - first half period  (of test 43) is not considered
#   - the output of first half period of test 43 is read as initial condition
#   - the results must then be EXACTLY the same as the second half period of test 43
#
#   note: [PE 13.7.]
#     - setting `init_projection: false` gives exactly the same results (ndiff=0)
#     - setting `init_projection: true` gives nearly the same results (ndiff=1e-13)
