# Test goal: Native output of DG transport concentration
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference: qualitative
#   - 2D DG transport on square with 4 regions with highly different conductivity
#   - concentration transport governed only by advection and boundary condition
#   - first half period - the domain is filling with concentration from BC
#   - second half period - the concentration is being washed away
#   - testing native output, the result after the first half period
#     is read by 43_square4x_DG_native_read.yaml (it runs only the second half period)
