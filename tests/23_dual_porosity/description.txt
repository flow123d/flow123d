Test problem 23
---------------
- Dual porosity test

- dual_por.con and dual_por_old.con solves the same simple transport 
  with dual porosity and compares results with the same reference data.
  This way the old and new dual porosity model is checked.
  
- dual porosity with following reactions is enabled but not tested with any reference data:
- dual_por_linear: 
    DualPorosity  -> Linear reaction in mobile zone
                  -> Linear reaction in immobile zone
                  
- dual_por_pade: 
    DualPorosity  -> Pade approximation reaction in mobile zone
                  -> Pade approximation reaction in immobile zone
                  
- dual_por_sorp: 
    DualPorosity  -> sorption in mobile zone
                  -> sorption in immobile zone
                  
- dual_por_sorp_linear: 
    DualPorosity  -> sorption in mobile zone    -> Linear reaction
                  -> sorption in immobile zone  -> Linear reaction
