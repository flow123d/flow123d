# Test goal: 2D elastic model with a single fracture with different BC.
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference:
#   - the domain is a square, chopped to its half
#   - the full model (with 2D fracture discretization) is used as qualitative reference
#     see 23_square_full_ref.yaml
#   - mechanics independent of flow, different BC prescribed in subsequent times
#     (see the note at the last problematic set of BC)
