# Test goal: 2D elastic model with a single barrier with different BC.
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference:
#   This is the same model as 23_square_fract_chopped.yaml with the difference,
#   that the fracture is stiff and acts as barrier.
#   The full model (with 2D fracture discretization) is used as qualitative reference,
#   see 24_square_full_ref.yaml
