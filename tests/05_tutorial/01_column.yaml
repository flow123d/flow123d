##title: Flow123d tutorial 1 -- ``1D column''
##---
##
### Description
##The first example is inspired by a real locality of a water treatment plant tunnel Bed≈ôichov in the granite rock massif.
##There is a particular seepage site 23 m under the surface which has a very fast reaction on rainfall events.
##Real data of discharge and concentration of stable isotopes are used.
##
## The user will learn how to:
##
##* Set up the mesh and flow model input parameters;
##* Set up the solver and output parameters.
##
##A pseudo one-dimensional model is considered in the range 10 $\times$ 23 m with the atmospheric pressure on the surface and on the bottom, and no flow boundary condition on the edges (Figure {@fig:column_geom}).
##
##![a) the mesh; b) the boundary conditions; c) computed piezometric head and flux.](tutor_figures/01_mesh_bc_flux.pdf){#fig:column_geom width=600px height=300px}
##
##
##
### Input
##The model settings are given in the control file, which is in YAML format.
##Every line contains one parameter and its value(s).
##The indentation of lines is important, since it indicates the section to which the parameter belongs.
##
#### Setting the computational mesh
##
##The mesh file can be generated using the software [GMSH](http://www.gmsh.info).
##It has to contain:
##
##* Nodes. Point coordinates.
##* Simplicial elements (lines, triangles, tetrahedra). Also elements of lower dimensions represent fractures or channels.
##* Physical domains (groups of elements, labeled either by a numerical id or a string caption). Names of regions defining boundary have to start by a dot.
##
##The mesh file is specified by the following lines:
##
##      mesh:
##        mesh_file: 01_mesh.msh
##
##
#### Setting the model and physical parameters
##In this example we use the Darcy flow model, which is set by:
##
##      flow_equation: !Flow_Darcy_MH
##
##*Note:
##The equation name consists of three parts: physical process (Flow), mathematical model (Darcy) and numerical method (MH = mixed hybrid finite element method).*
##
##The bulk parameters and boundary conditions are defined in the section ```input_fields```.
##For the rock massif (```region: rock```) we prescribe the hydraulic conductivity $K = 10^{-8}$ m/s (typical value for the granite rock massif):
##
##      input_fields:
##        - region: rock
##          conductivity: 1e-8
##
##We prescribe the atmospheric presure both at the surface and the tunnel:
##
##        - region: .tunnel
##          bc_type: dirichlet
##          bc_pressure: 0
##        - region: .surface
##          bc_type: dirichlet
##          bc_pressure: 0
##
##If no boundary condition is given then the default "no flow" is applied.
##
#### Setting solver parameters
##For the solution of the linear algebra problem we have to specify solver type and tolerances for controlling the residual.
##In ```flow_equation``` we can use either ```Petsc``` solver which performs well for small and moderate size problems, or ```Bddc``` (a scalable domain decomposition solver).
##Two stopping criteria can be given: absolute and relative tolerance of residual.
##
##      nonlinear_solver:
##        linear_solver: !Petsc
##          a_tol: 1e-15
##          r_tol: 1e-15
##
##The key ```nonlinear_solver``` has further parameters which play role in other (nonlinear) flow models.
##
#### Setting output
##In the section ```output_stream``` we define the file name and type (supported types are ```gmsh``` and ```vtk```, which can be viewed by GMSH, ParaView, respectively) to which the solution is saved:
##
##      output_stream:
##        file: flow.msh
##        format: !gmsh
##
##The list of fields (solution components, input fields etc.) to be saved is specified by:
##
##      output:
##        fields:
##          - piezo_head_p0
##          - pressure_p0
##          - velocity_p0
##
##The above code can be alternatively written in a more compact form, namely
##
##      output:
##        fields: [piezo_head_p0, pressure_p0, velocity_p0]
##
##In addition to the output of solution, Flow123d provides computation of balance of fluid volume, flux through boundaries and volume sources.
##This is turned on by
##
##      balance: {}
##
### Results
##The results of computation are generated to the files ```flow.msh``` and ```water_balance.txt```.
##From the balance file, one can see that the input flux on the surface is $1 \times 10^{-7}$ and the output flux on the tunnel is $-1 \times 10^{-7}$ (Table @tbl:tunnel_water_balance).
##
##"time"|    "region"|    "quantity [m(3)]"|    "flux"|    "flux_in"|    "flux_out"|
##----|-----------|-------------|-----:|----------:|------------:|
##0|    "rock"|    "water_volume"|    0|    0|    0|
##0|    ".surface"|    "water_volume"|    1e-07|    1e-07|    0|
##0|    ".tunnel"|    "water_volume"|    -1e-07|    0|    -1e-07|
##0|    "IMPLICIT BOUNDARY"|    "water_volume"|    2.58e-26|    6.46e-26|    -3.87e-26|
##
##: Results in ```water_balanced.txt``` (edited table, extract from the file). {#tbl:tunnel_water_balance}
##
### Variant
##Control file ```02_column_transport.yaml``` contains modified boundary conditions and solute transport model for the same physical problem.
