# Test goal: Richards equation with water source..
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference:
#   It is the same case as test 02_1d_dirichlet, but with a source term instead of Dirichlet BC.
#   It is not possible to set the source term so the solution would correspond to 02_1d_dirichlet
#   beacuse we do not have Robin like source term dependent on pressure "sigma_f(h-h_f)".
#   The source term is set to max. value, for which the nonlinear solver converges.
#   At the end time, the domain is fully saturated up to approx. z=-0.175.
#   Checked only qualitatively in Paraview
