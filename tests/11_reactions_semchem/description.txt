Test problem 11
---------------
- radioactive decay described by combination of kinetic constants and halflives, decay chain is divided into branches,
-- 8 isotopes (A, B, .., H) are transported and all of them are members of considered decay chain with branches (bifurcation) which looks as folows
--- E->D, D->F, F->B, 0.2*B->A, 0.2*B->G, 0.6*B->H, A->G, H->G, G->C
--- Initail conditions look as follows, A_0 = 0.01, B_0 = 0.02, C_0 = 0.03, D_0 = 0.04, E_0 = 0.05, F_0 = 0.06, G_0 = 0.07, H_0 = 0.08.
--- Transport boundary conditions does not matter because zero presure gradient is considered.
--- Final concentrations of all isotopes except C decrease to zero after 20 time steps, whereas C concentration grows to 0.36.
