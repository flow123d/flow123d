How to make unit tests for Flow123d
===================================

Basic structure of test that need not to use MPI is:
----------------------------------------
#include "gtest/gtest.hh"

TEST( class_name, test_name ) {
	...
} 
----------------------------------------

If you want to use MPI just replace include with:
#include <gtest_mpi.hh>

Optionally you can include "gtest_throw_what.hh", that provides macro

EXPECT_THROW_WHAT( code_to_throw, exception_class, pattern_of_what_message )

to test thrown exception together with message provided by standard what() method of the exception. 

Neccessary modifications in CMakeLists.txt:
1) to add new test file "some_test.cpp" in existing subdirectory "subdir", just add
define_test("some") or define_mpi_test(n_proc, "some") into "subdir/CMakeLists.txt".
Test files has to be named "*_test.cpp".

2) to add new directory "subdir" you have to:
- put add_subdirecctory("subdir") into "test_units/CMakeLists.txt" 
- make file "test_units/subdir/CMakeLists.txt" (start with copy of the existing one)
  - aware where are implemented tested classes and add appropriate libraries to:
    set( super_test_libs ... ). Name of libraries could be found in:
    src/CMakeLists.txt


The CMake system provides macro UNIT_TESTS_SRC_DIR, that expands to root directory of
unit tests, like "/home/jb/workspace/flow123d/trunk/test_units". This can be used to 
read some test files stored under this path.

GTest overview
====================================================================================


simple test
===========
TEST(test_case_name, test_name) {
  ...
}

fixture test (have prepared environment for each test)
============

class ClassTest {
  SetUp() {...}
  TearDown() {...}
}

TEST_F(ClassTest, test_name) {
  ...
}


assert vs. expect
=================
ASSERT_EQ( expected, tested);	-- aborts test on failure
EXPECT_EQ( expected, tested);	-- continues test on failure

FAIL(); 		// generate fatal failure -- aborts test
ADD_FAILURE(); 		// generate non-fatal failure -- test continues

expect/assert macros
====================
EXPECT_TRUE( condition );
EXPECT_FALSE( condition );

EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);	expected == actual
EXPECT_NE(val1, val2); 		val1 != val2
EXPECT_LT(val1, val2); 		val1 < val2
EXPECT_LE(val1, val2); 		val1 <= val2
EXPECT_GT(val1, val2); 		val1 > val2
EXPECT_GE(val1, val2); 		val1 >= val2

EXPECT_STREQ(expected_str, actual_str); 	the two C strings have the same content
EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2); 			the two C strings have different content
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(expected_str, actual_str); 	the two C strings have the same content, ignoring case
EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2);			the two C strings have different content, ignoring case

EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(expected, actual); 		the two float values are almost equal (relative error against 'expected', tolerance = 2 last bits)
EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(expected, actual);		the two double values are almost equal
EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error);		abs(val1 - val2) < abs_error

checking exceptions and error messages
======================================
EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type); 	statement throws an exception of the given type
EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement); 			statement throws an exception of any type
EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement); 			statement doesn't throw any exception 

EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex); 		statement crashes with error containing 'regex' (regular expresion)

Using from Eclipse
==================
Creating build configuration for input_test target.

Create new build configuration: 
  Project ->Properties ->C/C++ Build -> Manage Configurations (key in dialog)
  Create configuration with name of the test
Setup the configuration:
  Project ->Properties ->C/C++ Build -> Configuration ... select the new one
  Project ->Properties ->C/C++ Build -> Build command ... set:  make -C test_units/input input_test
  
Thats all.
