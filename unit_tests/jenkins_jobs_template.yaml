# TODO:
# - needs slihtly different setting for 
# linux-release:
#  - wipe out everythink (build external packages)
#  - optimal build of PETSC
#  - run banchmarks
#  - triger once a day
#  - run packaging and publish

# JJB pitfalls:
#   * does not ignore unknown names in YAML file, so we can not use references
#     to define lists at beginning by other script 
#     fix: patch that only warn for unknown names
#
#   * multijob has key 'projects:' which should be 'jobs:' and should accept
#     template expansion line project does
#   
#   * can not use job names with spaces, must override it using display-name
#  
#   *

# - we can still get this parallel problem when some library do not build

# - ultimate solution may be: do not have independent jobs for individual unit tests
#   just present generated XML files and use parallel make to make all unit tests and libraries
