### List of processed meshes of benchmark unit tests.
### 
### You can execute benchmark tests with different meshes and their sizes.
### Add or comment items in following arrays.
### 
### Example:
### Benchmark test is DG_asm_bench and you want to process only one type of mesh and two sizes.  
### Keep active only one item of array 'dg_asm' (eg. 'square_2D_uniform') and two items of 
### array 'meshes_sizes' (eg. 'small' and 'big'). Comment other items of both arrays. Then test 
### is executed on two following meshes: 
###   'square_2D_uniform_small.msh'
###   'square_2D_uniform_big.msh'
### 
### If you want to add new mesh you must add .msh file to directory:
###   ./build-<name-of-your-branch>/benchmark_meshes/
