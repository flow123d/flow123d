Goal: create here an overview of flow123d use cases/ applications/ projects

TODO:

- collect images and applications from different resources: 
    - flow123d.github.io gallery
    - flow123d tutorials
    - Bedřichov decovalex, proudění transport, Milan
    - UJV úmělá puklina, Milan
    - enhanced geothermal system
    - endorse poroelasticity, bayes inversion
    - endorse transport model
    - Bukov experiment model
    - 

- points for main chalanges of the application cases, fix application titles, put there figures
- With help of AI create full text description of application cases.
