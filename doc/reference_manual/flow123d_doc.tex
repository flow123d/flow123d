\chapter{Quick start}

Flow123D is a software for simulation of water flow and reactionary solute transport in a heterogeneous 
porous and fractured medium. In particular it is suited for simulation of underground processes in a granite rock massive.
The program is able to describe explicitly processes in 3D medium, 2D fractures, and 1D channels and exchange between 
domains of different dimensions. The computational mesh is therefore collection of 3D tetrahedrons, 2D triangles and 1D line segments.

The water flow model assumes a saturated medium described by Darcy law. For discretization, we use lumped mixed-hybrid finite element method.
We support both steady and unsteady water flow. The water flow model can be sequentially coupled with two different models for a solute transport or with a heat transfer model.

The first solute transport model can deal only with pure advection of several substances without any diffusion-dispersion term. It uses 
explicit Euler method for time discretization and finite volume method for space discretization and operator splitting method to 
couple with various processes described by the reaction term. The reaction term can treat any meaningful combination of the dual porosity, adsorptions, decays and linear reactions.
Alternatively, one can use interface to the experimental SEMCHEM package for more complex geochemistry.

The second solute transport model describes general advection with hydrodynamic dispersion for several substances. It uses implicit Euler method for time discretization and discontinuous Galerkin method of
the first or second order for the discretization in space. Currently there is no support for reaction term, the operator splitting approach (although it is not suited for implicit time schemes) 
is planed for the next version.

The heat transfer model assumes equilibrium between temperature of the rock and the fluid phase. It uses same numerical scheme as the second transport model.

The program support output of all input and many output fields into two file formats. You can use file format of GMSH mesh generator and post-processor 
or you can use output into widely supported VTK format. In particular we recommend Paraview software for visualization and post-processing of the VTK data.

The program is implemented in C/C++ using essentially PETSC library for linear algebra. All models can run in parallel using MPI environment, however, 
the scalability of the whole program is limited due to serial mesh and serial outputs.


The program is distributed under GNU GPL v. 3 license and is available on the project web page:
\url{http://dev.nti.tul.cz/trac/flow123d}

with sources on the GitHub:
\url{https://github.com/flow123d/flow123d}.

\section{Basic usage}

\subsection{How to run the simulation.}
On the Linux system the program can be started either directly or through a script \verb'flow123d.sh'. When started directly, e.g. by the command
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
the program requires one argument after switch \verb'-s' which is the name of the principal input file. Full list of possible command line arguments is as follows.

%  --help                  produce help message
%  -s [ --solve ] arg      Main input file to solve.
%  -i [ --input_dir ] arg  Directory for the ${INPUT} placeholder in the main 
%                          input file.
%  -o [ --output_dir ] arg Directory for all produced output files.
%  -l [ --log ] arg        Set base name for log files.
%  --no_log                Turn off logging.
%  --no_profiler           Turn off profiler output.
%  --full_doc              Prints full structure of the main input file.
%  --JSON_template         Prints description of the main input file as a valid 
%                          CON file.
%  --latex_doc             Prints description of the main input file in Latex 
%                          format using particular macros.


\begin{description}

 \item[{\tt -i, --input\_dir}] \verb'<directory>' \hfill\\
 	The place holder \verb"${INPUT}" %$
  	used in the path of an input file will be replaced by given Default value is \verb'input'.. Default value is \verb'input'.
 \item[{\tt -o, --output\_dir}] \verb'<directory>' \hfill\\
 	All paths for output files will be relative to this Default value is \verb'input'.. Default value is \verb'output'.
 \item[{\tt -l, --log}] \verb'<file_name>' \hfill\\
 	Set base name of log files. Default value is \verb'flow123d'. The log files are individual for every MPI process, placed in the output directory. 
 	The MPI rank of the process and the \verb'log' suffix are appended to the base name.
 \item[{\tt --no\_log}] \hfill\\
        Turn off logging.
 \item[{\tt --no\_profiler}] \hfill\\
        Turn off profiler output.
 \item[{\tt --full\_doc}] \hfill\\
        Prints full structure of the main input file.

        Prints a description of the main input file as a valid CON file template.
 \item[{\tt --latex\_doc}] \hfill\\ 
        Prints a description of the main input file in LaTeX format using particular macros.
\end{description}
All other parameters will be passed to the PETSC library. An advanced user can influence lot of parameters of linear solvers. In order to get list of supported options 
use parameter \verb'-help' together with some valid input. Options for various PETSC modules are displayed when the module is used for the first time.


Alternatively, you can use script \verb'flow123d.sh' to start parallel jobs or limit resources used by the program. 
This script accepts the same parameters as the program itself
and further following additional parameters:

\begin{description}
  \item[-h] \hfill\\
  	Usage overview.
  \item[-t {\bf\it timeout}] \hfill\\
  	Upper estimate for real running time of the calculation. Kill calculation after {\it timeout} seconds. 
  	Can also be used by PBS to choose appropriate job queue. 
  \item[-np {\bf\it number of processes}] \hfill\\
  	Specify number of parallel processes for calculation.
  \item[-m {\bf\it memory limit}] \hfill\\
  	Limits total available memory to {\it memory limit} bytes.
  \item[-n {\bf\it priority}] \hfill\\
  	Change (lower) priority for the calculation. See {\tt nice} command.
  \item[-r {\bf\it out file}] \hfill\\
  	Stdout and stderr will be redirected to {\it out file}.
\end{description}

On the Windows system we use Cygwin libraries in order to emulate Linux API.
Therefore you have to keep the Cygwin libraries within the same direcotry as the program executable.
The Windows package that can be downloaded from project web page contains both the Cygwin libraries
and the mpiexec command for starting parallel jobs on the Windows workstations.

Then you can start the sequential run by the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d.exe -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
or the parallel run by the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > mpiexec.exe -np 2 flow123d.exe -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
The program accepts the same parameters as the Linux version, but there is no script similar to \verb'flow123d.sh' for the Windows system.


\subsection{Tutorial problem}
\subsubsection{CON file format}
The main input file uses a slightly extended JSON file format which together with some particular constructs forms a CON (C++ object notation) file format. 
Main extensions of the JSON are unquoted key names (as long as they do not contain whitespaces), possibility to use \verb'=' instead of \verb':' 
and C++ comments, i.e. \verb'//' for a one line and \verb'/* */' for a multi-line comment. In CON file format, we prefer to call JSON objects ``records'' and we introduce also ``abstract records''
that mimic C++ abstract classes, arrays of a CON file have only elements of the same type (possibly using abstract record types for polymorphism). 
The usual keys are in lower case and without spaces (using underscores instead),
there are few special upper case keys that are interpreted by the reader: \verb'REF' key for references, \verb'TYPE' key for specifing actual type of an abstract record.
For detailed description see Section \ref{sec:CONformat}.

\subsubsection{Geometry}
In the following, we shall provide a commented input for the tutorial problem:
\begin{verbatim}
tests/03_transport_small_12d/flow_vtk.con
\end{verbatim}

We consider a~simple 2D problem with a branching 1D fracture (see Figure \ref{fig:tutorial} for the geometry). To prepare a~mesh file we use the \href{http://geuz.org/gmsh/}{GMSH software}.
First, we construct a~geometry file. In our case the geometry consists of: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item one physical 2D domain corresponding to the whole square
 \item three 1D physical domains of the fracture
 \item four 1D boundary physical domains of the 2D domain
 \item three 0D boundary physical domains of the 1D domain
\end{itemize}
In this simple example, we can in fact combine physical domains in every group, however we use this more complex setting for
demonstration purposes. Using GMSH graphical interface we can prepare the GEO file where physical domains are referenced by numbers, then we use 
any text editor and replace numbers with string labels in such a way that the labels of boundary physical domains start with the dot character. 
These are the domains where we will not do any calculations but we will use them for setting boundary conditions.
Finally, we get the GEO file like this:

\begin{multicols}{2}
{\small
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left]
cl1 = 0.16;
Point(1) = {0, 1, 0, cl1};
Point(2) = {1, 1, 0, cl1};
Point(3) = {1, 0, 0, cl1};
Point(4) = {0, 0, 0, cl1};
Point(6) = {0.25, -0, 0, cl1};
Point(7) = {0, 0.25, 0, cl1};
Point(8) = {0.5, 0.5, -0, cl1};
Point(9) = {0.75, 1, 0, cl1};
Line(19) = {9, 8};
Line(20) = {7, 8};
Line(21) = {8, 6};
Line(22) = {2, 3};
Line(23) = {2, 9};
Line(24) = {9, 1};
Line(25) = {1, 7};
Line(26) = {7, 4};
Line(27) = {4, 6};
Line(28) = {6, 3};
\end{Verbatim}
\columnbreak
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left, firstnumber=last]
Line Loop(30) = {20, -19, 24, 25};
Plane Surface(30) = {30};
Line Loop(32) = {23, 19, 21, 28, -22};
Plane Surface(32) = {32};
Line Loop(34) = {26, 27, -21, -20};
Plane Surface(34) = {34};
Physical Point(".1d_top") = {9};
Physical Point(".1d_left") = {7};
Physical Point(".1d_bottom") = {6};
Physical Line("1d_upper") = {19};
Physical Line("1d_lower") = {21};
Physical Line("1d_left_branch") = {20};
Physical Line(".2d_top") = {23, 24};
Physical Line(".2d_right") = {22};
Physical Line(".2d_bottom") = {27, 28};
Physical Line(".2d_left") = {25, 26};
Physical Surface("2d") = {30, 32, 34};
\end{Verbatim}
}
\end{multicols}

Notice the labeled physical domains on lines 26 -- 36. Then we just set the discretization step \verb'cl1' and use GMSH to create the mesh file.
The mesh file contains both the 'bulk' elements where we perform calculations and the 'boundary' elements (on the boundary physical domains) where we only set the boundary conditions.

\pagebreak
Having the computational mesh, we can create the main input file with the description of our problem. 
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left]
{
  problem = {
    TYPE = "SequentialCoupling", 
    description = "Transport 1D-2D, (convection, dual porosity, sorption)", 
    mesh = {
      mesh_file = "./input/mesh_with_boundary.msh",
      sets = [
          { name="1d_domain", 
            region_labels = [ "1d_upper", "1d_lower", "1d_left_branch" ]
          }
        ]
    },  
\end{Verbatim}
The file starts with a particular problem type selection, currently only the type \verb'SequentialCoupling' is supported, and a textual problem description.
Next, we specify the computational mesh, here it consists of the name of the mesh file and the declaration of one {\it region set} 
composed of all 1D regions i.e. representing the whole fracture. Other keys of the mesh record allow labeling regions given only by numbers, 
defining new regions in terms of element numbers (e.g to have leakage on single element), 
defining boundary regions, and set operations with region sets, see Section \ref{sec:Mesh} for details.

\subsubsection{Flow setting}
Next, we setup the flow problem. We shall consider a flow driven only by the pressure gradient (no gravity),
setting the Dirichlet boundary condition on the whole boundary with the pressure head equal to $x+y$. 
The conductivity will be $1$ on the 2D domain and $10$ on the 1D domain.
The fracture width will be $\delta_1=1$ (quite unnatural) as well as the transition parameter 
$\sigma_2 = 1$ which describes a ``conductivity'' between dimensions. 
These are currently the default values.

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left, firstnumber=last]
    primary_equation = {
      TYPE = "Steady_MH", 

      bulk_data = [
        { r_set = "1d_domain", conductivity = 10 },
        { region = "2d",       conductivity = 1  }
      ],
      
      bc_data = [
        { r_set = "BOUNDARY",
          bc_type = "dirichlet",
          bc_pressure = { TYPE="FieldFormula", value = "x+y" }
        }
      ],

      output = {
        output_stream = { REF = "/system/output_streams/0" }, 
        pressure_p0 = "flow_output_stream", 
        pressure_p1 = "flow_output_stream", 
        velocity_p0 = "flow_output_stream"
      }, 
      
      solver = { TYPE = "Petsc", accuracy = 1e-07 }
    }, // primary equation
\end{Verbatim}
On line 11, we specify particular implementation (numerical method) of the flow solver, in this case the Mixed-Hybrid
solver for unsteady problems. On lines 16 -- 19, we set mathematical fields that live on the computational domain 
(i.e. the bulk domain), we set only the conductivity field since other \hyperlink{IT::DarcyFlowMH-Steady-BulkData}{bulk fields} have appropriate default values.
On lines 21 -- 26, we set fields for boundary conditions (\hyperlink{IT::DarcyFlowMH-Steady-BulkData}{{\tt bc\_data}}). 
We use implicitely defined set ``BOUNDARY'' that contains all boundary regions and set there dirichlet boundary condition in terms of the 
pressure head. In this case, the field is not of the implicit type {\tt FieldConstant}, so we must specify the type of the field {\tt TYPE=FieldFormula}.
See Section \ref{sec:Fields} for other field types. 
On lines 28 -- 33, we specify which output fields should be written into which output stream (that means particular output file, with given format).
Currently, we support only one output stream per equation, so this allows at least switching individual output fields on or off. 
Notice the reference used on line 29 pointing to the definition of the output streams at the end of the file. Finally, we specify type of the linear solver and its tolerance.



\subsubsection{Transport setting}
We also consider subsequent transport problem with the porosity $\theta = 0.25$ and zero initial concentration. The boundary condition is equal to $1$ and is automatically applied only on the 
inflow part of the boundary. There are also some adsorption and dual porosity models in this particular test case. Adsorption and simple reactions model inputs are particularly described in subsections \ref{subsubsec:sorptions}.%, but we do not discuss this topic here for the sake of simplicity.
%see Section \ref{} for the description. 

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left, firstnumber=last]
     secondary_equation = {
      TYPE = "TransportOperatorSplitting", 

      dual_porosity = true, 
      substances = [ "age", "U235", "U235s-lin", "U235s-lang", "U235s-freund"],
      
      bulk_data = [
        { r_set = "ALL",
          init_conc = 0,
          por_m = 0.25,
          por_imm = 0.25
        }
      ],
      
      bc_data = [
        { r_set = "BOUNDARY",
          bc_conc = 1.0
        }
      ],

      output = {
        output_stream = { REF = "/system/output_streams/1" },
        save_step = 0.01,
        mobile_p0 = "transport_output_stream"
      }, 

      time = { end_time = 1.0 }      

      reactions = {
        TYPE="Sorptions",
        solvent_dens = 1.0,
        species = [ "age", "U235", "U235s-lin", "U235s-lang", "U235s-freund"],
        molar_masses = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        solubility = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        substeps = 50,
        bulk_data = [
          {
            region = "2d",
            rock_density = {TYPE="FieldFormula", value = "1.0*x/x"},
            sorption_types = [ "none",  "none", "linear", "langmuir", "freundlich"],
            mult_coefs = [0, 0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.6],
	    second_params = [0, 0, 0, 0.6, 0.4]
          }
        ]
      }
    } // secondary_equation
  }, // problem
\end{Verbatim}
For the transport problem we use implementation called ``TransportOperatorSplitting'' which is explicit finite volume solver of the convection equation (without diffusion), 
the operator splitting is used for the equilibrium adsorption as well as for the dual porosity model and first order reactions simulation. Dual porosity is switched on as we can see on lines 40. On the next line, 
we set names of transported substances, here it is the age of the water and the uranium 235. On lines 44 -- 55, we set the bulk fields in particular the porosity 'por\_m' and the initial concentrations 
( one for every substance ). However, on line 46, we see only single value since an automatic conversion is applied to turn the scalar zero into the zero vector (of size 2). 
On line 53, we can see vector that set different adsorption coefficients for the two substances. Then, on lines 57 -- 61, we set the boundary fields namely the concentration on the inflow part of the boundary.
We need not to specify type of the condition since currently this is the only one available. In the output record we have to specify the save step (line 65) for the output fields. And finally,
we have to set the time setting, here only the end time of the simulation since the step size is determined from the CFL condition, however you can set smaller time step if you want.

\subsubsection{Sorption settings}\label{subsubsec:sorptions}
The input information for equilibrial sorption are enclosed in the record \hyperA{TransportOperatorSplitting::reactions}{$reactions =\{\ldots\}$}. The type of simulated, chemical interactions is determinated by the label $TYPE="Sorptions",$. It is possible to set the value of the solvent (obviously water) density \hyperA{Sorptions::solvent-dens}{$solvent\_dens = 1.0,$}. The solvent density is supposed to be constant all over the simulated area. The vector \hyperA{Sorptions::species}{$species$} containes the list of soluted substances whose concentrations is concidered to be affected by sorptions. Material characteristics of all the sorbing species can be defined by vectors \hyperA{Sorptions::molar-masses}{$molar\_masses$} and \hyperA{Sorptions::solubility}{$solubility$}. Elements of the vector $sollubility$ defines the upper bound of an aqueous concentrations which can appear, because some substances have limmited solubility and if the solubility exceeds this limit they start to precipitate. $solubility$ is 
a crucial parameter for solving further described set of nonlinear equations. The parameter \hyperA{Sorptions::substeps}{$substeps$} is important when interpolation is used to search approximative solution of the adsorption problem. It is the number of precomputed points lying on the isotherm. Default value is set to be $100$.

The record \hyperA{Sorptions::bulk-data}{$bulk\_data$} colects information about regions specific, several isotherms desribed adsorption. Particular region (bulk Physical Entity), where one kind of adsorption takes place, can be specified by its label from gmsh-file. All implemented types of adsorption can take the rock density in region into account. The value of \hyperA{Sorption-BulkData::rock-density}{$rock\_density$} can be either constant or specified by $FieldFormula$. The implemented \hyperA{Sorption-BulkData::sorption-types}{$sorption\_types$} can have one of four possible values $\{ "none", "linear", "freundlich", "langmuir"\}$ and except of first one are those types empiricaly described by appropriate type of isotherm. Linear isotherm described adsorption needs just one parameter to be given whereas Freundlichs' and Langmuirs' isotherm have two parameters. For further details about mathematical description see the section \ref{sec:sorp_math}. Isothermaly described sorption simulation can be used in 
the case of low concenttrated solutions without competition between multiple disoved species.

\subsubsection{Output streams and results}

The end of the input file contains declaration of two output streams, one for the flow problem and one for the transport problem. Currently, we support output into VTK format and GMSH data format.
On Figure \ref{fig:tutorial} you can see the results, the pressure and the velocity field on the left and the concentration of U235 at time $t=0.9$ on the right. Even if the pressure gradient is
the same on the 2D domain as on the fracture, the velocity field is ten times faster on the fracture. Since porosity is same, the substance is transported faster by the fracture and
then appears in the bottom left 2D domain before the main wave propagating solely through the 2D domain.

The output files can be either \verb'*.msh' files accepted by the GMSH or one can use VTK format that can be post-processed by Paraview.

In the following chapter, we briefly describe structure of individual input files in particular the main INI file. In the last chapter, we describe
mathematical models and numerical methods used in the Flow123d.


\chapter{Mathematical models \\of physical reality}
\label{PhysicalModels}

Flow123d provides models for Darcy flow in porous media as well as for the transport and reactions of solutes. In this section, we describe 
mathematical formulations of these models together with physical meaning and units of all involved quantities. In the first section we present 
basic notation and assumptions about computational domains and meshes that combine different dimensions. In the next section we
derive approximation of thin fractures by lower dimensional interfaces for a general transport process. Latter sections describe details for models of particular
physical processes.

\section{Meshes of mixed dimension}
Common and unique feature of all models in Flow123d is the support of
domains with mixed dimension. 
Let $\Omega_{3} \subset \Real^3$ be an open set representing continuous approximation of porous and fractured medium.
Similarly, we consider a 2D manifold $\Omega_2\subset\overline\Omega_3$, representing 2D fractures and a 1D manifold $\Omega_1\subset \overline\Omega_2$ of 1D channels or preferential paths (see Fig \ref{fig:multi-dim}).
We assume that $\Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1$ are polytopic (i.e. polygonal and piecewise linear, respectively).
For every dimension $d=1,2,3$, we introduce a triangulation $\mathcal{T}_{d}$ of the open set $\Omega_d$
that consists of finite elements $T_{d}^{i},$\ $i = 1,\dots,N_{E}^{d}$.
The elements are simplices, i.e. lines, triangles and tetrahedra, respectively.

    \label{fig:multi-dim}
    Scheme of a problem with domains of multiple dimensions.
}
\end{figure}

Present numerical methods require meshes satisfying the compatibility conditions
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap T_d \subset \mathcal{F}_d,   \qquad \text{where } \mathcal{F}_d = \bigcup_{k} \partial T_{d}^{k}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap \mathcal{F}_d    \text{ is either $T_{d-1}^i$ or $\emptyset$}    
\end{equation}
for every $i\in\{1,\dots, N_{E}^{d-1}\}$, $j\in\{1,\dots,N_{E}^{d}\}$,  and $d=2,3$. That is, the $(d-1)$-dimensional elements are either between $d$-dimensional elements and
match their sides or they poke out of $\Omega_d$. 

\section{Advection-diffusion processes on fractures}
\label{sc:ad_on_fractures}
In this section, we shall derive a model for a general advection-diffusion process in a domain of mixed dimensions using
simple approximations inspired by the paper \citet{martin_modeling_2005}. Let us consider a fracture as a strip domain 
\[
 \Omega_f \subset [0,\delta] \times \Real^{d-1}
\]
for $d=2$ or $d=3$ and surrounding continuum domains
\[
 \Omega_1 \subset (-\infty,0)\times \Real^{d-1},
 \Omega_2 \subset (\delta,\infty)\times \Real^{d-1}.
\]
Further, we denote by $\gamma_i$, $i=1,2$ the fracture faces common with domains $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ respectively.
By $x$, $\vc y$ we denote normal and tangential coordinate of a point in $\Omega_f$. 
We consider the normal vector  $\vc n=\vc n_1=-\vc n_2=(1,0,0)^\top$.
An advection-diffusion process is given by equations:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:fr:continuity}
  \prtl_t w_i + \div \vc j_i &= f_i&&  \text{on } \Omega_i,\ i=1,2,f,\\
  \label{eq:fr:flux}
  \vc j_i &= - \tn A_i\grad u_i + \vc b_i w_i&& \text{on } \Omega_i,\ i=1,2,f,\\
  \label{eq:fr:Dirichlet}
  u_i &= u_f&& \text{on } \gamma_i,\ i=1,2,\\
  \label{eq:fr:Neumann}
  \vc j_i \cdot \vc n &= \vc j_f \cdot \vc n&& \text{on } \gamma_i,\ i=1,2,
\end{align}
where $w_i=w_i(u_i)$ is the conservative quantity and $u_i$ is the principal unknown, $\vc j_i$ is the flux of $w_i$, $f_i$ is the source term,
$\tn A_i$ is the diffusivity tensor and $\vc b_i$ is the velocity field. We assume that the tensor $\tn A_f$ is symmetric positive definite 
with one eigenvector in the direction $\vc n$. Consequently the tensor has the form:
\[
 A_f = \begin{pmatrix} 
            a_n & 0  \\
            0 & \tn A_t
       \end{pmatrix}
\]
Furthermore, we assume that $\tn A_f(x, \vc y)=\tn A_f(\vc y)$ is constant in the normal direction.

Our next aim is to integrate equations on the fracture $\Omega_f$ in the normal direction 
and obtain their approximations on the surface $\gamma=\Omega_f \cap \{x=\delta/2\}$ running through the middle of the fracture. 
For the sake of clarity, we will not write subscript $f$ for quantities on the fracture. 
To make the following procedure mathematicaly correct we have to assume that functions
$\prtl_x w$, $\prtl_x \grad_{\vc y} u$, $\prtl_x \vc b_{\vc y}$ are continuous and bounded on $\Omega_f$. Here and later on 
$\vc b_x=(\vc b \cdot \vc n)\, \vc n$ is the normal part of the velocity field and $\vc b_{\vc y} = \vc b - \vc b_x$ is the tangential part.
The same notation will be used for normal and tangential part of the field $\vc q$.

We integrate \eqref{eq:fr:continuity} over the fracture opening $[0,\delta]$ and use approximations to get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fracture_continuity}
   \prtl_t (\delta W) - \vc j_2 \cdot \vc n_2 - \vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1 + \div \vc J = \delta F,
\end{equation}
where for the first term, we have used mean value theorem, first order Taylor expansion, 
and boundedness of $\prtl_x w$ to obtain approximation:
\[
    \int_0^\delta w(x,\vc y) \d x=\delta w(\xi_{\vc y}, \vc y) = \delta W(\vc y) + O(\delta^2\abs{\prtl_x w}),
\]
where
\[
    W(\vc y)=w(\delta / 2,\vc y)=w(u(\delta/2,\vc y))=w(U(\vc y)).
\]
Next two terms in \eqref{eq:fracture_continuity} come from the exact integration 
of the divergence of the normal flux $\vc j_x$.
Integration of the divergence of the tangential flux $\vc j_{\vc y}$ gives the fourth term, where we introduced
\[
\vc J(\vc y) = \int_0^\delta \vc j_{\vc y}(x, \vc y) \d x.
\]
In fact, this flux on $\gamma$ is scalar for the case $d=2$. Finally, we integrate the right-hand side to get 
\[
    \int_0^\delta f(x,\vc y) \d x = \delta F(\vc y) + O(\delta^2\abs{\prtl_x f}),\quad F(\vc y)=f(\delta/2,\vc y). 
\]


Due to the particular form of the tensor $\tn A_f$, we can separately integrate tangential and normal
part of the flux given by \eqref{eq:fr:flux}. Integrating the tangential part and using approximations
\[
    \int_0^\delta  \grad_{\vc y} u(x, \vc y) \d x = \delta \grad_{\vc y} u (\xi_{\vc y}, \vc y) 
    = \delta \grad_{\vc y} U( \vc y) + O\big( \delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x\grad_{\vc y} u} \big) 
\]
and
\[
 \int_0^\delta \big(\vc b_{\vc y} w\big)(x, \vc y) \d x 
  = \delta \vc B(\vc y) W(\vc y) + O\big(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x(\vc b_{\vc y} w)} \big)
\]
where
\[
  \vc B(\vc y) = \vc b_{\vc y}(\delta/2, \vc y),
\]
we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fracture_darcy}
   \vc J = -\tn A_t \delta \grad_{\vc y} U + \delta \vc B W + O\big(\delta^2(\abs{\prtl_x\grad_{\vc y} u}+\abs{\prtl_x(\vc b_{\vc y} w)})\big).
\end{equation}


So far, we have derived equations for the state quantities $U$ and $\vc J$ on the fracture manifold $\gamma$. In order to
get a well possed problem, we have to prescribe two conditions for boundaries $\gamma_i$, $i=1,2$. To this end, we
perform integration of the normal flux $\vc j_x$, given by \eqref{eq:fr:flux}, separately for the left and right half of the fracture.
Similarly as before we use approximations
\[
 \int_0^{\delta/2} \vc j_x \d x = (\vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1)\frac{\delta}{2} + O(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x \vc j_x})
\]
and 
\[
 \int_0^{\delta/2} \vc b_x w \d x = (\vc b_1 \cdot \vc n_1)\tilde{w}_1\frac{\delta}{2} + O(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x \vc b_x}\abs{w} + \delta^2\abs{\vc b_x}\abs{\prtl_x w})
\]
and their counter parts on the interval $(\delta/2, \delta)$ to get
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:fracture_normal_1}
     \vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1 &= -\frac{2a_n}{\delta} (U - u_1) + \vc b_1\cdot \vc n_1 \tilde{w}_1\\
    \label{eq:fracture_normal_2}
    \vc j_2 \cdot \vc n_2 &= -\frac{2a_n}{\delta} (U - u_2) + \vc b_2\cdot \vc n_2 \tilde{w}_2
\end{align}
where $\tilde w_i$ can be any convex combination of $w_i$ and $W$. Equations \eqref{eq:fracture_normal_1}  
and \eqref{eq:fracture_normal_2} have meaning of a semi-discretized flux from domains $\Omega_i$ into fracture.
In order to get a stable numerical scheme, we introduce a kind of upwind already on this level using a different convex 
combination for each flow direction:
\begin{align}
   \notag 
   \vc j_i \cdot \vc n_i
       = &-\sigma_i (U - u_i)      \\ 
   \notag
      &+ \big[\vc b_i\cdot \vc n_i\big]^{+} \big(\xi w_i + (1-\xi) W\big)       \\
      \label{eq:fracture_normal}
      &+ \big[\vc b_i\cdot \vc n_i\big]^{-} \big((1-\xi) w_i + \xi W\big), \qquad i=1,2
\end{align}
where $\sigma_i = \frac{2a_n}{\delta}$ is the transition coefficient and the parameter $\xi\in [\frac12, 1]$ can be used to interpolate
between upwind ($\xi = 1$) and central difference ($\xi=\frac12$) scheme. Equations \eqref{eq:fracture_continuity}, \eqref{eq:fracture_darcy}, and
\eqref{eq:fracture_normal} describe the general form of the advection-diffusion process on the fracture and its communication with 
the surrounding continuum which we shall later apply to individual processes.
