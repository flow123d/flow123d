\section{Introduction}
Flow123D is a software for simulation of water flow, reactionary solute transport and heat transfer in a heterogeneous 
porous and fractured medium. In particular it is suited for simulation of underground processes in a granite rock massive.
The program is able to describe explicitly processes in 3D medium, 2D fractures, and 1D channels and exchange between 
domains of different dimensions. The computational mesh is therefore a collection of tetrahedra, triangles and line segments.

The water flow model assumes a saturated medium described by the Darcy law. For discretization, we use lumped mixed-hybrid finite element method.
We support both steady and unsteady water flow. The water flow model can be sequentially coupled with two different models for a solute transport or with a heat transfer model.

The first solute transport model can deal only with pure advection of several substances without any diffusion-dispersion term. It uses 
explicit Euler method for time discretization and finite volume method for space discretization and operator splitting method to 
couple with various processes described by the reaction term. The reaction term can treat any meaningful combination of the dual porosity, sorptions, decays and linear reactions.
Alternatively, one can use interface to the experimental SEMCHEM package for more complex geochemistry.

The second solute transport model describes general advection with hydrodynamic dispersion for several substances. It uses implicit Euler method for time discretization and discontinuous Galerkin method of
the first, second or third order for the discretization in space. Currently there is no support for reaction term, the operator splitting approach (although it is not suited for implicit time schemes) 
is planned for the next version.

The heat transfer model assumes equilibrium between temperature of the rock and the fluid phase. It uses the same numerical scheme as the second transport model.

The program support output of all input and many output fields into two file formats. You can use file format of GMSH mesh generator and post-processor 
or you can use output into widely supported VTK format. In particular we recommend Paraview software for visualization and post-processing of the VTK data.

The program is implemented in C/C++ using essentially PETSC library for linear algebra. All models can run in parallel using MPI environment, however, 
the scalability of the whole program is limited due to serial mesh and serial outputs.


The program is distributed under GNU GPL v. 3 license and is available on the project web page:
\url{http://flow123d.github.io}

with sources on the GitHub:
\url{https://github.com/flow123d/flow123d}.


\section{Reading Documentation}
The Flow123d documentation has two main parts. The first three chapters form a user manual which
starts with getting and running the program and tutorial problem in chapter \ref{chapter:getting_started}. 
The second chapter \ref{chapter:mathematical_models} provides detailed description of mathematical models
of physical reality. The third chapter \ref{chapter:file-formats} documents all file types used by Flow123d, 
including mesh files, input and output files.

The second main part, consisting only of the chapter \ref{chapter:input-tree-reference}, is automatically
generated. It mirrors directly the code and contains the whole input tree of the main input file. Description
of input records, their structure and default values are supplied there and bidirectional links to the user 
manual are provided.


\section{Running Flow123d}
On the Linux system the program can be started either directly or through a script \verb'flow123d.sh', both placed in the \verb'bin' directory of the installation 
package or of the source tree. When started directly, e.g. by the command
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
the program requires one argument after switch \verb'-s' which is the name of the principal input file. Full list of possible command line arguments is as follows.

%  --help                  produce help message
%  -s [ --solve ] arg      Main input file to solve.
%  -i [ --input_dir ] arg  Directory for the ${INPUT} placeholder in the main 
%                          input file.
%  -o [ --output_dir ] arg Directory for all produced output files.
%  -l [ --log ] arg        Set base name for log files.
%  --no_log                Turn off logging.
%  --no_profiler           Turn off profiler output.
%  --full_doc              Prints full structure of the main input file.
%  --JSON_template         Prints description of the main input file as a valid 
%                          CON file.
%  --latex_doc             Prints description of the main input file in Latex 
%                          format using particular macros.


\begin{description}
 \item[{\tt --help}] \hfill\\
        Parameters interpreted by Flow123d. Remaining parameters are passed to PETSC.
 \item[ {\tt -s, --solve} ] \verb'<file>' \hfill\\
 	 Set principal CON input file. All relative paths in the CON file are relative against current directory.
 \item[{\tt -i, --input\_dir}] \verb'<directory>' \hfill\\
 	The placeholder \verb"${INPUT}" %$
  	used in the path of an input file will be replaced by the \verb'<directory>'. Default value is \verb'input'.
 \item[{\tt -o, --output\_dir}] \verb'<directory>' \hfill\\
 	All paths for output files will be relative to this \verb'<directory>'. Default value is \verb'output'.
 \item[{\tt -l, --log}] \verb'<file_name>' \hfill\\
 	Set base name of log files. Default value is \verb'flow123d'. The log files are individual for every MPI process, placed in the output directory. 
 	The MPI rank of the process and the \verb'log' suffix are appended to the base name.
 \item[{\tt --no\_log}] \hfill\\
        Turn off logging.
 \item[{\tt --no\_profiler}] \hfill\\
        Turn off profiler output.

        Prints full structure of the main input file.
 \item[{\tt --latex\_doc}] \hfill\\ 
        Prints a description of the main input file in LaTeX format using particular macros.
\end{description}
All other parameters will be passed to the PETSC library. An advanced user can influence lot of parameters of linear solvers. In order to get list of supported options 
use parameter \verb'-help' together with some valid input. Options for various PETSC modules are displayed when the module is used for the first time.


Alternatively, you can use script \verb'flow123d.sh' to start parallel jobs or limit resources used by the program. 
The syntax is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  flow123d.sh [OPTIONS] -- [FLOW_PARAMS]
\end{verbatim}
where everything after double dash is passed as parameters to the flow123d binary. The script accepts following options:

\begin{description}
  \item[{\tt -h, --help}] \hfill\\
  	Usage overview.
  \item[{\tt --host}] \verb'<hostname>' \hfill\\
        Default value is the host name obtained by system \verb'hostname' command, this argument can be used to override it. 
        Resulting value is used to select a backend script \verb'config/<hostname>.sh', which describes particular method how to start 
        parallel jobs, usually through some sort of PBS job queue system. If the script is not found, we try to start parallel processes 
        directly on the actual host."
  \item[{\tt -t, --walltime}] \verb'<timeout>' \hfill\\
  	Upper estimate for real running time of the calculation. Kill calculation after {\it timeout} seconds. 
  	Can also be used by PBS to choose appropriate job queue. 
  \item[{\tt -np}] \verb'<number of processes>' \hfill\\
  	Specify number of MPI parallel processes for calculation.
  \item[{\tt -m, --mem}] \verb'<memory limit>' \hfill\\
  	Limits total available memory to \verb'<memory limit>' bytes per process.
  \item[{\tt -n, --nice}] \verb'<niceness>' \hfill\\
  	Change priority of the calculation, higher values means lower priority. See the {\tt nice} command.
  \item[{\tt -ppn}] \verb'<processes per node>' \hfill\\
       Set number of processes started on one node for multicore systems. 
       Number of processes set by \verb'-np' parameter should be divisible by \verb'<processes per node>'.
  \item[{\tt -q, --queue}] \verb'<queue>' \hfill\\
       Select particular job queue on PBS systems. If running without PBS, 
       it redirects stdout and stderr to the file \verb'<queue>.<date>', which appended date and time of the start of the job.
\end{description}

On the windows operating systems, we use Cygwin libraries in order to emulate Linux API.
Therefore you have to keep the Cygwin libraries within the same directory as the program executable.
The Windows package that can be downloaded from project web page contains both the Cygwin libraries
and the mpiexec command for starting parallel jobs on the windows based workstations.

Then you can start the sequential run by the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > flow123d.exe -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
or the parallel run by the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  > mpiexec.exe -np 2 flow123d.exe -s example.con
\end{verbatim}
The program accepts the same parameters as the Linux version, but there is no script similar to \verb'flow123d.sh' for the windows operating systems.




\input{tutorial}

In the following chapter we describe mathematical models used in Flow123d.
Then in chapter \ref{chapter:file-formats} we briefly describe structure of individual input files, in particular the main CON file.
The complete description of the CON format is given in chapter \ref{chapter:input-tree-reference}.


\chapter[Mathematical Models of Physical Reality]{Mathematical Models \\of Physical Reality}
\label{chapter:mathematical_models}

Flow123d provides models for Darcy flow in porous media as well as for the transport and reactions of solutes. In this section, we describe 
mathematical formulations of these models together with physical meaning and units of all involved quantities. In the first section we present 
basic notation and assumptions about computational domains and meshes that combine different dimensions. In the next section we
derive approximation of thin fractures by lower dimensional interfaces for a general transport process. Latter sections describe details for models of particular
physical processes.

\section{Meshes of Mixed Dimension}
Unique feature common to all models in Flow123d is the support of
domains with mixed dimension. 
Let $\Omega_{3} \subset \Real^3$ be an open set representing continuous approximation of porous and fractured medium.
Similarly, we consider a set of 2D manifolds $\Omega_2\subset\overline\Omega_3$, representing the 2D fractures and a set of 1D manifolds $\Omega_1\subset \overline\Omega_2$ 
representing the 1D channels or preferential paths (see Fig \ref{fig:multi-dim}).
We assume that $\Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1$ are polytopic (i.e. polygonal and piecewise linear, respectively).
For every dimension $d=1,2,3$, we introduce a triangulation $\mathcal{T}_{d}$ of the open set $\Omega_d$
that consists of finite elements $T_{d}^{i},$\ $i = 1,\dots,N_{E}^{d}$.
The elements are simplices, i.e. lines, triangles and tetrahedra, respectively.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{\fig/ground_fractures}
\caption{
    \label{fig:multi-dim}
    Scheme of a problem with domains of multiple dimensions.
}
\end{figure}

Present numerical methods used by the software require meshes satisfying the compatibility conditions
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap T_d \subset \mathcal{F}_d,   \qquad \text{where } \mathcal{F}_d = \bigcup_{k} \partial T_{d}^{k}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap \mathcal{F}_d    \text{ is either $T_{d-1}^i$ or $\emptyset$}    
\end{equation}
for every $i\in\{1,\dots, N_{E}^{d-1}\}$, $j\in\{1,\dots,N_{E}^{d}\}$,  and $d=2,3$. 
That is, the $(d-1)$-dimensional elements are either between $d$-dimensional elements and
match their sides or they poke out of $\Omega_d$. Support for a coupling between non-compatible
meshes of different dimesion is in developement and partly supported by the Darcy Flow model.

\section{Advection-Diffusion Processes on Fractures}
\label{sc:ad_on_fractures}
This section presents derivation of an abstract advection-diffusion process on 2D and 1D manifolds and its coupling with
the higher dimensional domains. The reader not interested in the details of this approximation may skip directly to
the later sections describing mathematical models of individual physical processes.

As was already mentioned, the unique feature of Flow123d is support of models living on 2D and 1D manifolds. The aim is to capture 
features significantly influencing the solution despite of their small cross-section. Such a tiny features are
challenging for numerical simulations since a direct discretization requires highly refined
computational mesh. One possible solution is to model these features (fractures, channels) 
as lower dimensional objects (2D and 1D manifolds) and introduce their coupling with the surrounding continuum.
The equations modeling a physical process on a manifold as well as its coupling to the model in the surrounding continuum
has to be derived from the model on the 3D continuum. This section presents such a procedure for the case of the abstract
advection-diffusion process inspired by the paper \cite{martin_modeling_2005}. Later, we this abstract approach to 
particular advection-diffusion processes: Darcian flow, solute transport, and heat transfer.

Let us consider a fracture as a strip domain 
\[
 \Omega_f \subset [0,\delta] \times \Real^{d-1}
\]
for $d=2$ or $d=3$ and surrounding continuum domains
\[
 \Omega_1 \subset (-\infty,0)\times \Real^{d-1},
 \Omega_2 \subset (\delta,\infty)\times \Real^{d-1}.
\]
Further, we denote by $\gamma_i$, $i=1,2$ the fracture faces common with domains $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ respectively.
By $x$, $\vc y$ we denote normal and tangential coordinate of a point in $\Omega_f$. 
We consider the normal vector  $\vc n=\vc n_1=-\vc n_2=(1,0,0)^\top$.
An advection-diffusion process is given by equations:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:fr:continuity}
  \prtl_t w_i + \div \vc j_i &= f_i&&  \text{on } \Omega_i,\ i=1,2,f,\\
  \label{eq:fr:flux}
  \vc j_i &= - \tn A_i\grad u_i + \vc b_i w_i&& \text{on } \Omega_i,\ i=1,2,f,\\
  \label{eq:fr:Dirichlet}
  u_i &= u_f&& \text{on } \gamma_i,\ i=1,2,\\
  \label{eq:fr:Neumann}
  \vc j_i \cdot \vc n &= \vc j_f \cdot \vc n&& \text{on } \gamma_i,\ i=1,2,
\end{align}
where $w_i=w_i(u_i)$ is the conservative quantity and $u_i$ is the principal unknown, $\vc j_i$ is the flux of $w_i$, $f_i$ is the source term,
$\tn A_i$ is the diffusivity tensor and $\vc b_i$ is the velocity field. We assume that the tensor $\tn A_f$ is symmetric positive definite 
with one eigenvector in the direction $\vc n$. Consequently the tensor has the form:
\[
 A_f = \begin{pmatrix} 
            a_n & 0  \\
            0 & \tn A_t
       \end{pmatrix}
\]
Furthermore, we assume that $\tn A_f(x, \vc y)=\tn A_f(\vc y)$ is constant in the normal direction.

Our next aim is to integrate equations on the fracture $\Omega_f$ in the normal direction 
and obtain their approximations on the surface $\gamma=\Omega_f \cap \{x=\delta/2\}$ running through the middle of the fracture. 
For the sake of clarity, we will not write subscript $f$ for quantities on the fracture. 
To make the following procedure mathematicaly correct we have to assume that functions
$\prtl_x w$, $\prtl_x \grad_{\vc y} u$, $\prtl_x \vc b_{\vc y}$ are continuous and bounded on $\Omega_f$. Here and later on 
$\vc b_x=(\vc b \cdot \vc n)\, \vc n$ is the normal part of the velocity field and $\vc b_{\vc y} = \vc b - \vc b_x$ is the tangential part.
The same notation will be used for normal and tangential part of the field $\vc q$.

We integrate \eqref{eq:fr:continuity} over the fracture opening $[0,\delta]$ and use approximations to get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fracture_continuity}
   \prtl_t (\delta W) - \vc j_2 \cdot \vc n_2 - \vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1 + \div \vc J = \delta F,
\end{equation}
where for the first term, we have used mean value theorem, first order Taylor expansion, 
and boundedness of $\prtl_x w$ to obtain approximation:
\[
    \int_0^\delta w(x,\vc y) \d x=\delta w(\xi_{\vc y}, \vc y) = \delta W(\vc y) + O(\delta^2\abs{\prtl_x w}),
\]
where
\[
    W(\vc y)=w(\delta / 2,\vc y)=w(u(\delta/2,\vc y))=w(U(\vc y)).
\]
Next two terms in \eqref{eq:fracture_continuity} come from the exact integration 
of the divergence of the normal flux $\vc j_x$.
Integration of the divergence of the tangential flux $\vc j_{\vc y}$ gives the fourth term, where we introduced
\[
\vc J(\vc y) = \int_0^\delta \vc j_{\vc y}(x, \vc y) \d x.
\]
In fact, this flux on $\gamma$ is scalar for the case $d=2$. Finally, we integrate the right-hand side to get 
\[
    \int_0^\delta f(x,\vc y) \d x = \delta F(\vc y) + O(\delta^2\abs{\prtl_x f}),\quad F(\vc y)=f(\delta/2,\vc y). 
\]


Due to the particular form of the tensor $\tn A_f$, we can separately integrate tangential and normal
part of the flux given by \eqref{eq:fr:flux}. Integrating the tangential part and using approximations
\[
    \int_0^\delta  \grad_{\vc y} u(x, \vc y) \d x = \delta \grad_{\vc y} u (\xi_{\vc y}, \vc y) 
    = \delta \grad_{\vc y} U( \vc y) + O\big( \delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x\grad_{\vc y} u} \big) 
\]
and
\[
 \int_0^\delta \big(\vc b_{\vc y} w\big)(x, \vc y) \d x 
  = \delta \vc B(\vc y) W(\vc y) + O\big(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x(\vc b_{\vc y} w)} \big)
\]
where
\[
  \vc B(\vc y) = \vc b_{\vc y}(\delta/2, \vc y),
\]
we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fracture_darcy}
   \vc J = -\tn A_t \delta \grad_{\vc y} U + \delta \vc B W + O\big(\delta^2(\abs{\prtl_x\grad_{\vc y} u}+\abs{\prtl_x(\vc b_{\vc y} w)})\big).
\end{equation}


So far, we have derived equations for the state quantities $U$ and $\vc J$ on the fracture manifold $\gamma$. In order to
get a well possed problem, we have to prescribe two conditions for boundaries $\gamma_i$, $i=1,2$. To this end, we
perform integration of the normal flux $\vc j_x$, given by \eqref{eq:fr:flux}, separately for the left and right half of the fracture.
Similarly as before we use approximations
\[
 \int_0^{\delta/2} \vc j_x \d x = (\vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1)\frac{\delta}{2} + O(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x \vc j_x})
\]
and 
\[
 \int_0^{\delta/2} \vc b_x w \d x = (\vc b_1 \cdot \vc n_1)\tilde{w}_1\frac{\delta}{2} + O(\delta^2 \abs{\prtl_x \vc b_x}\abs{w} + \delta^2\abs{\vc b_x}\abs{\prtl_x w})
\]
and their counter parts on the interval $(\delta/2, \delta)$ to get
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:fracture_normal_1}
     \vc j_1 \cdot \vc n_1 &= -\frac{2a_n}{\delta} (U - u_1) + \vc b_1\cdot \vc n_1 \tilde{w}_1\\
    \label{eq:fracture_normal_2}
    \vc j_2 \cdot \vc n_2 &= -\frac{2a_n}{\delta} (U - u_2) + \vc b_2\cdot \vc n_2 \tilde{w}_2
\end{align}
where $\tilde w_i$ can be any convex combination of $w_i$ and $W$. Equations \eqref{eq:fracture_normal_1}  
and \eqref{eq:fracture_normal_2} have meaning of a semi-discretized flux from domains $\Omega_i$ into fracture.
In order to get a stable numerical scheme, we introduce a kind of upwind already on this level using a different convex 
combination for each flow direction:
\begin{align}
   \notag 
   \vc j_i \cdot \vc n_i
       = &-\sigma_i (U - u_i)      \\ 
   \notag
      &+ \big[\vc b_i\cdot \vc n_i\big]^{+} \big(\xi w_i + (1-\xi) W\big)       \\
      \label{eq:fracture_normal}
      &+ \big[\vc b_i\cdot \vc n_i\big]^{-} \big((1-\xi) w_i + \xi W\big), \qquad i=1,2
\end{align}
where $\sigma_i = \frac{2a_n}{\delta}$ is the transition coefficient and the parameter $\xi\in [\frac12, 1]$ can be used to interpolate
between upwind ($\xi = 1$) and central difference ($\xi=\frac12$) scheme. Equations \eqref{eq:fracture_continuity}, \eqref{eq:fracture_darcy}, and
\eqref{eq:fracture_normal} describe the general form of the advection-diffusion process on the fracture and its communication with 
the surrounding continuum which we shall later apply to individual processes.
