\section{Transport of Substances}
\label{sc:transport_model}

The motion of substances dissolved in water is governed by the \emph{advection}, and the \emph{hydrodynamic dispersion}.
In $\Omega_d$, $d\in\{1,2,3\}$, we consider the following system of mass balance equations\footnote{For $d\in\{1,2\}$ this form can be derived as in Section \ref{sc:ad_on_fractures} using $w:=\delta\th c^i$, $u:=c^i$, $\tn A:=\delta\th\tn D^i$, $\vc b:=\vc v=\frac{\vc q}{\th\delta}$.}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{e:ADE}
   \partial_t ( \delta \th c^i) + \div ( \vc q c^i ) - \div (\th \delta \D^i \grad c^i ) = F_S^i + F^c_C(c^i) + F_R(c^1,\dots, c^s).
\end{equation}
The principal unknown is the concentration $c^i$ \units{1}{-3}{} of a substance $i\in\{1,\dots, s\}$, which means weight of the substance in unit volume of the water.
Other quantities are:
\begin{itemize}

\item $\th$ \units{}{}{} is the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::porosity}{porosity}, i.e. fraction of space occupied by water and the total volume.
\item The hydrodynamic dispersivity tensor $\D^i$ \units{}{2}{-1} has the form
\begin{equation} 
  \label{eqn:transport_disp}
  \D^i =D_m^i \tau \tn I + \abs{\vc v}\left(\alpha_T^i \tn I + (\alpha_L^i - \alpha_T^i) \frac{\vc v \otimes \vc v}{\abs{\vc v}^2}\right),
\end{equation}
which represents (isotropic) molecular diffusion, and mechanical dispersion in longitudal and transversal direction to the flow.
Here $D_m^i$ \units{}{2}{-1} is the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::diff-m}{molecular diffusion coefficient} of the $i$-th substance (usual magnitude in clear water is $10^{-9}$), $\tau=\th^{1/3}$ is the tortuosity (by \cite{millington_quirk}), $\alpha_L^i$ \units{}{1}{} and $\alpha_T^i$ \units{}{1}{} is the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::disp-l}{longitudal dispersivity} and the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::disp-t}{transverse dispersivity}, respectively.
Note that although we allow dispersivities to have different values for different substances, it is often assumed that they are intrinsic parameters of the porous medium.
Finally, $\vc v$ \units{}{1}{-1} is the \emph{microscopic} water velocity, related to the Darcy flux $\vc q$ by the relation $\vc q = \th\delta\vc v$.
The value of $D_m^i$ for specific substances can be found in literature (see e.g. \cite{cislerova_vogel}).
For instructions on how to determine $\alpha_L^i$, $\alpha_T^i$ we refer to \cite{marsily,domenico_schwartz}.

\item $F_S^i$ \units{1}{-d}{-1} represents the density of concentration sources.
Its form is:
\begin{equation}
 F_S^i = \delta f^i_S + \delta(c_S^i-c^i)\sigma_S. \label{eqn:transport_sources}
\end{equation}
Here $f_S^i$ \units{1}{-3}{-1} is the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::sources-density}{density of concentration sources}, $c_S^i$ \units{1}{-3}{} is an \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::sources-conc}{equilibrium concentration} and $\sigma_S^i$ \units{}{}{-1} is the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::sources-sigma}{concentration flux}.

\item $F^c_C(c^i)$ \units{1}{-d}{-1} is the density of concentration sources due to exchange between regions with different dimensions, see \eqref{e:FC} below.

\item The reaction term $F_R(\dots)$ \units{1}{-d}{-1} is thoroughly described in the next section \ref{sec:reaction_term}.
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Initial and boundary conditions.}
At time $t=0$ the concentration is determined by the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::init-conc}{initial condition}
$$ c^i(0,\vc x) = c^i_0(\vc x). $$
The physical boundary $\partial\Omega_d$ is decomposed into the parts $\Gamma_I\cup\Gamma_D\cup\Gamma_N\cup\Gamma_R$, which may change during simulation time.
The first part $\Gamma_I$ is further divided into two segments:
\begin{align*}
\Gamma_I^+(t) &= \{\vc x\in \partial\Omega_d\where \vc q(t,\vc x)\cdot\vc n(\vc x)<0\},\\
\Gamma_I^-(t) &= \{\vc x\in \partial\Omega_d\where \vc q(t,\vc x)\cdot\vc n(\vc x)\ge 0\},
\end{align*}
where $\vc n$ stands for the unit outward normal vector to $\partial\Omega_d$.
We prescribe the following boundary conditions:
On $\Gamma_D$, the user must provide \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::bc-conc}{Dirichlet boundary condition} $c_D^i$ for concentrations:
$$ c^i = c^i_D \mbox{ on }\Gamma_D. $$
On the inflow $\Gamma_I^+$ the \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::bc-conc}{reference concentration} $c_D^i$ is enforced through total flux:
$$ (\vc q c^i - \th\delta\D^i\nabla c^i)\cdot\vc n = \vc q\cdot\vc n c_D^i \mbox{ on }\Gamma_I^+, $$
on $\Gamma_I^-$ we impose homogeneous Neumann boundary condition:
$$ -\th\delta\D^i\nabla c^i\cdot\vc n = 0 \mbox{ on }\Gamma_I^-, $$
on $\Gamma_N$ we impose Neumann boundary condition with user-defined \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::bc-flux}{concentration flux} $f^i_N$:
$$ -\th\delta\D^i\nabla c^i\cdot\vc n = f^i_N \mbox{ on }\Gamma_N, $$
and finally on $\Gamma_R$ we impose Robin boundary condition through \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::bc-robin-sigma}{transition parameter} $\sigma^i_R$ and \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::bc-conc}{reference concentration} $c^i_D$:
$$ -\th\delta\D^i\nabla c^i\cdot\vc n = \sigma^i_R(c^i-c^i_D) \mbox{ on }\Gamma_R. $$






\paragraph{Communication between dimensions.}
Transport of substances is considered also on interfaces of physical domains with adjacent dimensions (i.e. 3D-2D and 2D-1D, but not 3D-1D).
Denoting $c_{d+1}$, $c_d$ the concentration of a given substance in $\Omega_{d+1}$ and $\Omega_d$, respectively, the comunication on the interface between $\Omega_{d+1}$ and $\Omega_d$ is described by the quantity
\begin{equation}
  \label{e:inter_dim_flux}
  q^c_{d+1,d} = \sigma^c_{d+1,d} \frac{\delta_{d+1}^2}{\delta_d}2\th_d\D_d:\n\otimes\n ( c_{d+1} - c_d) + \begin{cases}q^l_{d+1,d} c_{d+1} & \mbox{ if }q^l_{d+1,d}\ge 0,\\q^l_{d+1,d} \frac{\th_d}{\th_{d+1}} c_d & \mbox{ if }q^l_{d+1,d}<0,\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $q^c_{d+1,d}$ \units{1}{-d}{-1} is the density of concentration flux from $\Omega_{d+1}$ to $\Omega_d$,
\item $\sigma^c_{d+1,d}$ \units{}{}{} is a \hyperA{SoluteTransport-DG-Data::fracture-sigma}{transition parameter}.
Its value determines the mass exchange between dimensions whenever the concentrations differ.
In general, it is recommended to leave the default value $\sigma^c=1$ or to set $\sigma^c=0$ (when exchange is due to water flux only).
\item $q^l_{d+1,d}$ \units{}{3-d}{-1} is the water flux from $\Omega_{d+1}$ to $\Omega_d$, i.e. $q^l_{d+1,d} = \vc q_{d+1}\cdot\n_{d+1}$.
\end{itemize}
The communication between dimensions is incorporated as the total flux boundary condition for the problem on $\Omega_{d+1}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{e:FC}
-\th\delta\D\nabla c\cdot\vc n + q^w c = q^c
\end{equation}
and a source term in $\Omega_d$:
\begin{equation}
F^c_{C3} = 0,\quad
F^c_{C2} = q^c_{32},\quad
F^c_{C1} = q^c_{21}.
\end{equation}



\paragraph{Mass balance.}
The advection-dispersion equation satisfies the balance of mass in the following form:
$$ m^i(0) + \int_0^t s^i(\tau) \,d\tau - \int_0^t f^i(\tau) \,d\tau = m^i(t) $$
for any instant $t$ in the computational time interval and any substance $i$.
Here
$$ m^i(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\Omega^d}(\delta\th c^i)(t,\vc x)\,d\vc x, $$
$$ s^i(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\Omega^d}F_S^i(t,\vc x)\,d\vc x, $$
$$ f^i(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\partial\Omega^d}\left(\vc q c^i - \th\delta\D^i\nabla c^i\right)(t,\vc x)\cdot\vc n \,d\vc x $$
is the mass \units{1}{}{}, the volume source \units{1}{}{-1} and the mass flux \units{1}{}{-1} of $i$-th substance at time $t$, respectively.
The mass, flux and source on every geometrical region is calculated at each computational time step and the values together with the control sums are written to the file \texttt{mass\_balance.txt}.


\paragraph{Two transport models.}
Within the above presented model, Flow123d presents two possible approaches to solute transport.
\begin{itemize}
\item For modelling pure advection ($\tn D=0$) one can choose {\tt TransportOperatorSplitting} method, which represents an explicit in time finite volume solver. The solution process for one time step is faster, but the maximal time step is restricted. The resulting concentration is piecewise constant on mesh elements. This solver supports reaction term (involving simple chemical reactions, dual porosity and sorption).
\item The full model including dispersion is solved by {\tt SoluteTransport\_DG}, an implicit in time discontinuous Galerkin solver. It has no restriction of the computational time step and the space approximation is piecewise polynomial, currently up to order 3. Reaction term is currently not implemented.
\end{itemize}
