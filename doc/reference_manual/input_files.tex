\section{Mesh and data file format MSH ASCII}
\label{mesh_file}

Currently, the only supported format for the computational mesh is MSH ASCII format used
by the GMSH software. You can find its documentation on:

\url{http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-ASCII-file-format}

The scheme of the file is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
$MeshFormat
<format version>
$EndMeshFormat

$PhysicalNames
<number of items>
<dimension>     <region ID>     <region label>
...
$EndPhysicalNames

$Nodes
<number of nodes>
<node ID> <X coord> <Y coord> <Z coord>
...
$EndNodes

$Elements
<number of elements>
<element ID> <element shape> <n of tags> <tags> <nodes>
...
$EndElements

$ElementData
<n of string tags>
    <field name>
    <interpolation scheme>
<n of double tags>
    <time>
<n of integer tags>
    <time step index>
    <n of components>
    <n of items>
    <partition index>
<element ID> <component 1> <component 2> ...
...
$EndElementData
\end{verbatim}
Detailed description of individual sections:
\begin{description}
 \item[{\tt PhysicalNames}] --- assign labels to region IDs
 \item[{\tt Nodes}] --- {\tt <number of nodes>} is also number of data lines that follows. 
    Node IDs are unique but need not to form an aritmetic sequance. Coordinates are float numbers.
 \item[{\tt Elements}] --- Element IDs are unique but need not to form an aritmetic sequence. 
    {\tt <element shape>} is integer code of the shape, we support only points (15), lines (1), triangles (2), and tetrahedrons (4).
    Default number of tags is 3. The first is the region ID, the second is ID of the geometrical entity (that was used in original geometry file from which the mesh was generated),
    and the third tag is the partition number. {\tt nodes} is list of node IDs with size according to the element shape.
 \item[{\tt ElementData}] --- the header has 2 string tags, 1 double tag, and 4 integer tags with default meaning. For the purpose of the \verb'FieldElementwise' the tags
    \verb'<field name>', \verb'<n of components>', and \verb'<n of items>' are obligatory.
