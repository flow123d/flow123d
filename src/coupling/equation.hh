 * Class EquationBase is abstract base class for a general time dependent model. This class should provide general interface
 * that can be used for general coupling of various particular models. By a model we mean a discrete solver of
 * an partial or ordinary differential equation. Result of the model at one discrete time level should be a discrete field class (not yet implemented).
 * Until we have field classes we only provide method get_solution_vector(), which returns pointer to sequential C array with linear combination of
 * base functions that represents the solution.
 *
 * Computation of one time step (method compute_one_step() )  is split into update_solution() and choose_next_time().
 *
 * This class does not implement any constructor. In particular it does not initialize mesh and time. This has to be done in the constructor
 * of particular child class.
 *
 * Any constructor of child class should set solved = true. We assume, that after initialization an equation object stay solve in init time. For the first time step
 * one calls method chose_next_time() which setup time frame of the first time step.
 *
 * TODO: clarify initialization of data members

/**
 * Base class for a data subclasses of equations. We suggest following structure of an equation class:

 *          ...
 *          }

 *
 *          ///
 *          EqData data_;
 *      }
 * @endcode
 * The @p SomeEquation::EqData class should be used to introduce all necessary data of the equation in terms of bulk (Field)
 * and boundary (BCField) fields. The base class EqDataBase implements some common operations with these fields as
 * construction of the Input::Type objects, reading fields from the input and calling set_time methods.
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 * Mechanism to access fields in EqData from other equations and vice versa, set (or copy) field from somewhere else.
 * - Is it necessary to have EqDataBase as separate class from EqBase ?
 * - getter mechanism:
 *   template <int spacedim, class T>
 *   Field<spacedim, T> *get_field(string &name) {
 *      FieldCommonBase *base_field = get_field_(name); // EqDataBase should have some name database
 *      if ( typeid(base_field) == typeid(Field<spacedim, T> *)
 *      return static_cast<...>(base_field)
 *   }
 *
 * - setter mechanism:
 *   - Should it suppress field on the input? Not easy to accomplish.
 *     Need way how to modify an Input::Type tree from higher levels,
 *     e.g. Let Equation1 to make its Input::Type::Record, make its deep_copy & modify it and use it by Equation_2
 *     After all Input::Type tree is just a definition of input structure. Seems that we made it too rigid.
