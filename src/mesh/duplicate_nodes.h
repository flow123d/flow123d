/**
 * Class DuplicateNodes constructs the graph structure of elements, their faces and nodes
 * without any other data such as coordinates or region numbers. The nodes are then
 * duplicated where the elements are separated by fractures (elements of lower dim.).
 * E.g.:
 * 
 * Consider a domain containing fracture like this:
 * +-----+-----+
 * |     |     |
 * |     +     |
 * |           |
 * |           |
 * |           |
 * +-----------+
 * 
 * with the mesh nodes numbered as follows:
 * 0-----1-----2
 * |     |     |
 * |     3     |
 * |           |
 * |           |
 * |           |
 * 4-----------5
 * 
 * The class duplicates node 1 and node 3 because in these nodes FE functions can be discontinuous
 * (schematic view):
 * 0-6   1   7-2
 * |  \  |  /  |
 * |   \ 3 /   |
 * |    \ /    |
 * |     8     |
 * |           |
 * 4-----------5
 * 
 * Now, nodes 1,6,7 have the same coordinates but belong to different groups of elements
 * and analogously nodes 3 and 8.
 * 
 * 
 * The structure is used in DOF handler to distribute dofs for FE spaces sharing dofs
 * between elements.
 * 
 * TODO: Currently we do not create faces of faces, i.e. 1d edges of tetrahedra are not
 * available. This should be implemented if we need to distribute dofs on edges.
 *
