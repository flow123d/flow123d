 * @brief Class for O(log N) lookup for intersections with a set of bounding boxes.
 *
 * Notes:
 * Assumes spacedim=3. Implementation was designed for arbitrary number of childs per node, but
 * currently it supports max 2 childs per node (binary tree).
 *
 * TODO:
 * - rename method find_element, radeji find_bounding_box
 * - new method find_point parametr Space<3>::Point , #include "mesh/point.hh"
