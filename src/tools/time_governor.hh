/**
 * @brief
 * Basic time management functionality for unsteady (and steady) solvers (class Equation).
 *
 * <h2> Common features and unsteady time governor (TG) </h2>
 * 
 * This class provides algorithm for selecting next time step, and information about current time step frame.
 * Step estimating is constrained by several bounds (permanent maximal and minimal time step, upper 
 * and lower constraint of time step). The permanent constraints are set in the constructor from the input 
 * record so that user can set the time step constraints for the whole simulation.
 * Function set_permanent_constraint() should be used only in very specific cases and possibly right after 
 * the constructor before using other functions of TG.
 * 
 * Choice of the very next time step can be constrained using functions set_upper_constraint()
 * and set_lower_constraint().
 * Lower and upper constraints are set equal to permanent ones in the constructor and can only 
 * become stricter. If one tries to set these constraints outside the interval of the previous constraints,
 * nothing is changed and a specified value is returned. Upper and lower constraints are reset in function
 * next_time() to the permanent constraints.
 * 
 * The later one can be called multiple times with various constraint values and we use the minimum of them.
 * Function next_time() choose the next time step in such a way that it meets actual constraints and
 * a uniform discrete time grid with this step hits the nearest fixed time in lowest possible number of steps.
 *
 * The fixed times are time marks of TimeMarks object passed at construction time with particular mask.
 *
 * There is just one set of time marks for the whole problem. Therefore TimeMarks object is static and is shared umong
 * all the equations and time governors. Each equation creates its own specific time mark type.
 *
 * Information provided by TG includes:
 * - actual time, last time, end time
 * - actual time step
 * - number of the time level
 * - end of interval with fixed time step
 * - time comparison
 * - static pointer to time marks
 * 
 * <h2> Steady time governor</h2>
 * 
 * Steady TG can be constructed by default constructor (initial time is zero) or by 
 * constructor with initial time as parameter. End time and time step are set to infinity. 
 * One can check if the time governor is steady by calling is_steady(). 
 * Calling estimate_dt() will return infinity.
 * 
 * Setting constraints have no consequences. Calling fix_dt_until_mark() will only return zero 
 * and will not do anything.
 * 
 * The steady TG works in two states. At first the time is set to initial and time level 
 * is equal zero. To use steady TG properly one should call next_time() after the computation 
 * of steady problem is done. Current time is then set to infinity, time level is set to 1 and 
 * calling estimate_dt() will return zero.
 * 
 * Note: For example class TransportNothing (which computes really nothing) uses also steady TG but
 * it calls next_time() immediately after TG's construction. This means that the 'computation'of transport 
 * is done.
