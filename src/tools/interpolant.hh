/// The main class for interpolation of functors.
/** This class is a wrapper of a functor (defined by class \ref FunctorBase) which provides
 * computation of derivates and interpolation of the functor. We will describe the functionality
 * in the following paragrahphs.
 *
 * ## Evaluation of a functor and its derivatives
 *
 * Beside the interpolation, the class provides calling of the functor itself.
 * All functions evaluating directly the functor starts with '`f_`', e.g. function \ref f_val computes the functor value.
 * 
 * We use the FADBAD++ library ([website](http://www.fadbad.com)) to compute derivatives of the functor. First derivatives
 * can be obtained by function \ref f_diff which uses backward automatic differentiation. Higher order derivatives can be 
 * obtained via \ref f_diffn which uses Taylor expansion method.
 * 
 * ## Interpolation
 * 
 * Sofar we provide only a  piecewise linear interpolation. Both the function and its derivative can be
 * interpolated. User has to provide the functor object to the constructor or later to the function \ref set_functor.
 * Then one must set at least the interval \f$ [a,b]\f$ by \ref set_interval and the size of the interpolation table 
 * by \ref set_size before calling \ref interpolate. Otherwise assert will crash the program in debug build.
 * 
 * When user wants the size to be chosen automatically then \ref set_size_automatic must be called at first.
 * An initial guess of size of the interpolation table and a tolerance which is assumed to be the maximum relative difference
 * between the function and the interpolant (sum of value and derivative difference) must be provided. 
 * Futher user can set the maximum size of the interpolation (default 1000) table which will not be exceeded and the type of norm
 * in which the estimate of the error of interpolation will be computed (enumerated in \ref ErrorNorm, default maximal norm).
 * See one of the following paragraphs to learn how we deal with the error of the interpolation.
 * 
 * Outside the given interval the interpolation is extrapolated. User can choose among several types of extrapolation
 * which are enumerated in \ref Extrapolation. Constant and linear extrapolation use the first and last interpolating polynomials
 * to compute the value. Functor type means that the functor itself will be evaluated outside the interval. Type of extrapolation
 * can be changed by \ref set_extrapolation function. Calling functor is the default type of extrapolation.
 * 
 * 
 * ### Error of the interpolation
 * 
 * We are interested in the maximum difference between the function value and its interpolation.
 * When interpolating also the derivative, we need to compute the difference between derivative and
 * its interpolation too.
 * Therefore we would like to compute something like the L-infinity norm, relative to function value and its derivative.
 * Let \f$ f(x), f'(x) \f$ be the function and its derivative and \f$ g(x), g'(x)\f$ interpolation of the function and interpolation 
 * of the derivative on the interval \f$ I \f$. We suggest an approximation of the infinity norm: 
 * \f[ 
 * \|f-g\|_\infty = \sup_{x\in I} F(x) = \sup_{x\in I} \left( \frac{|f(x)-g(x)|}{|f(x)| + tol} + \frac{|f'(x)-g'(x)|}{|f'(x)| + tol} \right)
 * \approx \max_{x\in J} \left( \frac{|f(x)-g(x)|}{|f(x)| + tol} + \frac{|f'(x)-g'(x)|}{|f'(x)| + tol} \right)
 * \f]
 * where \f$ J \f$ is set of points that lies in the middle of two neighboring nodes. \f$ tol \f$ is a given tolerance for zero (avoids zero division).
 * When computing the size of the interpolation table automatically, we compare the user tolerance \f$ TOL \f$ given by \ref set_size_automatic funtion 
 * directly with the estimated value of the supremum norm.
 * 
 * This approach is fast and when computing the size automatically, we use the computed values (middle points, function and derivative values) in next
 * interpolation. On the other hand this does not work good around zero points of the function where the value is small and the fraction becomes large or does
 * not converge when dividing the intervals (\f$ x^2 \f$ is a good example).
 * 
 * Therefore we provide also error estimation with \f$ L_p \f$ and \f$ W_p^1 \f$ norm. Then the user given tolerance is compared
 * as it is stated in the following inequation:
 * \f[
 * \left( \frac{\int \limits_I F^p(x) \,\rm{d} x}{|I|} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \leq TOL.
 * \f]
 * This approach is much more expensive but can give better results.
 * 
 * TODO: Improve error computation. Suggest more robust method. 
 * 
 * ### Evaluation statistics
 * 
 * We collect some statistics during the evaluation of the interpolant in the struct \ref InterpolantBase::EvalStatistics -- total number of calls, number of evaluations
 * inside the interpolation interval and number of evaluation outside the interval. One can use these statistics to decide whether it is necessary
 * to widen the interval and recompute the interpolation. Function \ref check_stats_and_reinterpolate is provided to do this automatically 
 * according to the given percentage of evaluation outside the interval.
