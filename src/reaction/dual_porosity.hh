 * @brief   Class Dual_por_exchange implements the model of dual porosity.
 * 
 * It can be part of the transport model and it computes the concentrations of substances both in 
 * mobile and immobile zone. This model can also work above the sorption model - the sorbed concentration
 * is then computed both from mobile and immobile concentrations. Linear reactions can be define 
 * also in both zones.
