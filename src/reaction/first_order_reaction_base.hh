/** @brief Base class for linear reactions and decay chain.
 *
 * The class implements common interface for linear reactions and decay chains.
 * One step of the linear reaction or the decay is represented as a product of a reaction matrix and
 * a vector of concentrations of transported substances on a single element.
 * 
 * It uses armadillo to compute the reaction matrix which then multiplies to concetration vector.
 * This class also resolves the choice of the numerical method which is used to compute the reaction matrix.
