/**
 * \enum UpdateFlags
 * @brief Enum type UpdateFlags indicates which quantities are to be
 * recomputed on each finite element cell.
 *
 * Selecting these flags in a restrictive way is crucial for the
 * efficiency of FEValues::reinit() and FESideValues::reinit().
 * Therefore, only the flags actually
 * needed should be selected. It is the responsibility of the involved
 * Mapping and FiniteElement to add additional flags according to
 * their own requirements.

 * By default, all flags are off, i.e. no reinitialization will be
 * done.
 *
 * You can select more than one flag by concatenation
 * using the bitwise or operator|(UpdateFlags,UpdateFlags).
 *
 * <h3>Generating the actual flags</h3>
 *
 * When given a set of UpdateFlags @p flags, the FEValues object must
 * determine, which values will have to be computed once only for the
 * reference cell and which values will have to be updated for each
 * cell. Here, it is important to note that in many cases, the
 * FiniteElement will require additional updates from the Mapping. To
 * this end, the following auxiliary functions have been implemented:
 *
  * FiniteElement::update_each() determine the values required by
 * the FiniteElement on each cell. The same function exists in Mapping.
 *
 * FEValuesBase::update_each() is used to compute the union
 * of all values to be computed ever. It does this by first adding to
 * the flags set by the user all flags added by the FiniteElement.
 * This new set of flags is then given to the Mapping and all flags
 * required there are added.
 *
 * This union of all flags is given to Mapping::fill_fe_values() and
 * FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(), where the quantities indicated by
 * the flags are computed.
 *
 * The flags finally stored in FEValues then are the union of all the
 * flags required by the user, by FiniteElement and by Mapping, for
 * computation once or on each cell.
