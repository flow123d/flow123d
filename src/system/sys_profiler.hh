 * @brief   
 * @todo
 * - START_GLOBAL_TIMER(tag) - this calls the start_timer, which creates local timer on the correct place in the hierarchy,
 *    further this timer is added to the list of global timers, this contains groups of timers with same tag, and
 *    collect/sum data from these timers in the report.
 *
 * - Allow output even during calculation (not complete, but at least some thing)
 *    Report should contain time of start as well as time of creation of the report or time from start of the program.
 *
 * - When generating report we has to deal with possibly different trees at every MPI process.
 *
 * - test memory profiling
 *   in our own new and xmalloc functions - register allocatied and deallocated memory to active Profiler frame.
 *
 * - test in parallel
 * - extended output:
 *      cas na jedno volani (jina redukce nez pro kumulativni cas, pokud je pocet volani ruzny)
 *      procenta vuci predkovi
 *      code point (az nekde na konci radky)
 *
 *
 *  !!! Unfortunately using constexpr is worse (without optimization).
 *  This is probably due to use of static variable for
 *  CodePoint, the access could be slow, and computation of hash is done only once. Actually timing results
 *  are:
 *
 *  OPTIONS     OVERHEAD (compared to call 2x clock())
 *  -g, no c++11 : 18%
 *  -g,    c++11 : 60%
 *  -O3,no c++11 : 6%
 *  -O3,   c++11 : 6%

 * 
 * The main idea of the approach described is that the TimerFrame variable will be destroyed
 * at the end of the block where #START_TIMER macro was used. In order to work properly
 * in situations where #END_TIMER was used to stop the timer manually before (but there is still the
 * variable which will be later destroyed), we have to store references to these variables and
 * destroy them on-demand.
 *
 * TODO:
