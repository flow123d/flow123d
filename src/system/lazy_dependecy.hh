/**
 * This class implements lazy dependency of objects that inherits from it.
 *
 * Consider you have equation E which depends on input vector fields A and B which are possibly results of another computations
 * and can change over time. When someone ask you for result of equation E you have to look if your current result is up to date according
 * to input fields A and B. This is purpose of this class.
 *
 * How to use it:
 * 1) make all classes in the dependency graph inherited form LazyDependency class. Multiple inheritance is OK in this case.
 * 2) equation E should call add_dependency for A and B
 * 3) every time you change A or B call update()
 * 4) when you are asked for result of equation check needs_update() and update the result only if it returns true
 *    Possibly call also update() for possible objects that depends on E.
