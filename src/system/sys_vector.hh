 *  Full iterator into a Vector<T> container. It makes
 *  an envelop around std:vector<T>::iterator, but stores also reference of
 *  the container it points into. Consequently FullIter can return index.
 *  The container has to be provided when FullIterator is created and this container can not be changed
 *  during the life of the variable. This is intentional since more safe.
 *
 *  This class is larger then normal pointer i.e. Iter type and therefore is questionable
 *  to use it in the large arrays. To this and you can use Iter and later convert it to FullIter
 *  providing the container It points into.

/**
 *  @brief Envelop over std::vector, use enhanced iterators.
 *
 *  Differences compared to std::vector.
 *
 *  -# Implement only subset of std::vector methods.
 *
 *  -# iterator Iter - which is nothing else then T *. This we use since it can be initializeted to NULL as universal "non valid value".
 *     for iterators one has to comapre to std::vector.end(), but the container is not always at hand.
 *     This should be used in complex mesh structures to save space.
 *
 *  -# iterator FullIter - this is standard iterator which contains also reference to the containre it points to. Then it has more
 *     save "non valid value" method. Can be constructer from Iter and a container. You can get the index of this iterator.
 *     This is meant to be use as local variable.
 *     Using this instead of standard iterators It provides function to get index of an iterator
 *
 *  -# Provides method to get index of a pointer i.e. Iter.
 *
 *  -# add_item can be used to add a new element and get reference to it so that it can be initialized
 *     Useful even for T be class since when creating a new element the default constructor is called
 *     which can not fill it with values.
 *
 *  <b> Developer note: </b>
 * 
 *  It appears very dangerous to combine reallocating std::vectors with iterators implemented as pointers.
 *  Indeed, when vector array is reallocated old pointers become invalid. One possibility is to strictly
 *  distinguish crating of the array and later creating references into it. Another is to implement iterators by indexes
 *  which means also to use only FullIterators.
