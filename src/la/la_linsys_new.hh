/**
 * Classes for block linear systems. Namely it should provide following functionality:
 * 1) interface to various PETSC (or possibly other) matrices, with preallocation
 *    through the set_values method
 * 2) For coupling problems creation of the global linear system by connectiong sub systems of individual
 *    equations. Working cycle could be:
 *    1. creation of sub problems up to the global problem (just matrix dimensions and types)
 *    2. pre assembly - > preallocation
 *    3. assembly - by the same functions
 *    4. matrix modifications (schur complements, assembly of one global matrix, preconditioners ...
 *    5. iterative solution in parallel
 *    6. for nonlinear/time problems: jump to 3. and reuse the structures
 *
 * 3) Solution through explicit or implicit schur complements
 * 4) Preconditioning for coupled problems .
 * 5) In assembly, the access to the matrices in LinSys hierarchy is through successive call of block(i,j) method, but
 *    there also should be a class or another mechanism how to represent a coordinate in the hierarchy. Then one can access a MatriSimple
 *    directly by two coordinates and constantly access correct part of rhs vector
 *
 * Virtual test cases:
 * - Only water flow solved by 1, 2, 3, or 4 (Newton BC) Schur complements, explict and implicit
 *   Ideal: switch between Implicit and explicit only changing the particular class or some thing similarly simple
 * -
 *
 * Unsolved design problems:
 * - PETSC neumoznuje blokove vektory, tj. vektory by mely byt globalni a z nich by se mely pouzivat podvektory
 *   mozne reseni: blokovy globalni vektor se hierarchicky vytvari (pouze velikosti) a pak slouzi jako
 *   "fabrika" na globalni vektory i subvektory a nebo pro pristup k subvektorum globalniho vektoru
 *   .. detaily

/**
 * Abstract class for frontend for PETSc matrices.
 * purpose:
 * - allow preallocation through double assembly
 * - make interface to PETSC since PETSC evolve and it is simpler to make changes on one place
 * - make documented interface to PETSC and document used PETSC functionality this way
 *
 * Questions:
 *  - how to setup column distribution. It is necessary only for some of PETSC formats, isn't it?
