/** Local system class is meant to be used for local assembly and then pass to global linear system.
 * The key idea is to take care of known solution values (Dirichlet boundary conditions) in a common way.
 * 
 * Usage the class consists of 3 steps:
 * 1) create local system, set global DoFs.
 * 2) set all known values (Dirichlet BC)
 * 3) set matrix and RHS entries 
 *    (if the entry is on dirichlet row or column, it is now taken care of)
 * 4) possibly fix the diagonal entries of the local system, where Dirichlet BC is set
