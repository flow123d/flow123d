/** Local system class is meant to be used for local assembly and then pass to global linear system.
 * The key idea is to take care of known solution values (Dirichlet boundary conditions) in a common way.
 * 
 * A] Usage of the class consists of 5 steps:
 * 1) create local system, set local/global DoFs.
 * 2) possibly setup sparsity pattern for the local system
 * 3) set matrix and RHS entries 
 * 4) set all known values (Dirichlet BC)
 *    (the order of items 3 and 4 does not matter)
 * 5) possibly eliminate the known solution
 *    (possibly fix the diagonal entries of the local system, where Dirichlet BC is set)
 * 6) pass the local system to the global system, possibly with the map local_to_global
 * 
 * B] Scenario with computation of Schur complement:
 * 1) do A1, do not have to set dof indices (if not doing B3)
 * 2) do A2, A3
 * 3) possibly do A4, A5, if there is known solution for the dofs not included in the Schur complement
 * 3) create another LocalSystem for Schur complement (local_schur), possibly set dof indices
 * 4) possibly do A2 on local_schur
 * 4) compute Schur complement, passing the prepared local_schur
 * 5) if not done before, set dof indices
 * 6) possibly do A4, A5 on local_schur
 * 7) do A6 with local_schur
 * 
 * C] Reconstruction from the Schur complement
 * 1) do A1, A3
 * 2) reconstruct the full solution
 * 
 * TODO:
 *  - set dofs as references
 *  - done: use arma::vec<int> to keep dofs (efficient, can be constructed from raw arrays)
 *  - done: use local dof indeces to set solution
 *  - rename set_solution to set_constraint
 *  -
