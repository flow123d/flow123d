/**
 * @brief class to manage local indices on sub-domain to global indices on domain
 *
 * Currently (March 2012) the local to global maps are managed by individual equations (e.g. DarcyFlow has el_4_loc .. there it is complicated
 * by different local indexing of elements, sides and edges). In fact el_4_loc etc. are new_local to old_global maps.
 * This map is created as follows:
 *
 * PETSC solver:
 * 1) create graph
 * 2) make partitioning
 * 2.5) create id_4_old (just used to create new_4_id, id was non continuous index not used anymore)
 * 3) call id_maps which:
 * 4) call ISPartitioninToNumbering : assign partitions to processors (identity, no optimization); make "distribution";
 *    make mapping (array of ints): old_local to new_global
 * 5) from this we crate AO (application ordering from PETSc)
 * 6) use AO to map identity array to old numbering -> creates map: new_global to old_global
 * 7) go through new_local continuous part and map it to old_global index
 * ---
 * So this produce new_local to old_global mapping and only for continuous part of local indices (not for ghost indices)
 * See that this works without any information about connectivity.
 *
 * METIS/BDDC solver:
 * 1) graph, partition of elements, maps for elements (no overlap, no ghost values) using id_maps function
 * 2) same for edges -> produce non overlapping local to global maps.
 * 3) use std::set to collect all dofs on local elements (pass through mesh) complexity: n*log(n) n-local number of dofs
 * 4) copy set to vector - makes local ordering arbitrary
 *
 * Future usage is:
 * - in mesh to map local idx of entities to global indices
 * - in dof handler to map local dofs idx to global
 *
 * In both cases the mapping is created by adding all global numbers on local subdomain. In order to keep local part of the map
 * continuous, we need Distribution that describes splitting of global indices into continuous blocks. This Distribution is known
 * as soon as we assign partitions to processors. So we assume that it is known at construction time.
