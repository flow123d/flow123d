/**
 * @brief Schur complement class for a PETSC based linear system
 *
 * Linear system consists of Matrix, inversion matrix, RHS, solution and pointer to Complement.
 * It provides methods for:
 * - set complement system
 * - create distribution of complement system
 * - create inversion matrix of system
 * - form Schur complement and rhs
 * - solve and resolve system
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @CODE
 *   SchurComplement * schur = new SchurComplement(is, &distr);
 *
 *   ... // allocation and assembly of matrix
 *
 *   LinSys_PETSC * ls = new LinSys_PETSC( schur->make_complement_distribution() );
 *   schur->set_complement( ls );
 *   schur->solve();
 * @ENDCODE
 *
 * Input record is passed to the complement system.
