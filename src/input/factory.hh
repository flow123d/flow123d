/**
 * This class implements more general factory mechanism to construct classes.
 *
 * One factory allows constructing derived classes of one base class. This class is determined
 * by template parameter Type and all descendants must implement constructor with same
 * parameters (given by template parameter Arguments). This constructor is called by factory.
 *
 * All descendants must contain:
 * 1. constructor with parameters given by Arguments
 * 2. declaration of parent class as typedef with name FactoryBaseType
 * 3. private static integer variable what is only for registration class to factory, this variable only allow
 *    to register class to factory and its implementation must call Factory::register_class what adds constructor
 *    of class to factory
 *
 * Simple example of usage:
 @code
     class SomeDescendant : public SomeBase
     {
     public:
        /// typedef of parent class
        typedef SomeBase FactoryBaseType;

		/// constructor
	    SomeDescendant() {}

     private:
     	/// registers class to factory
   	    static const int reg;
     }

     /// implementation of registration variable
     const int SomeDescendant::reg =
		 Input::register_class< SomeDescendant >("SomeDescendant");
 @endcode
 *
 * Factory allow to accept constructor with one or more parameters. In this case Factory is
 * also templated by these parameters. For example Factory< SomeBase, int, double > accepts
 * constructors with two parameters (int, double).
 *
 * If registered class is templated the following design have to be used:
 @code
     /// Example of class templated by integer parameter
     template <int dimension>
     class SomeDescendant : public SomeBase<dimension>
     {
     public:

		/// constructor
	    SomeDescendant(double time) {}
  	    ...
     }

     /// implementation of registration variable
     const int SomeDescendant::reg =
		 Input::register_class< SomeDescendant<dimension>, double >("SomeDescendant");
 @endcode
 *
 * Factory can be used in two ways:
 * - through Factory::create method
 *   Example for constructor with one parameter:
 @code
     SomeBase * sb = Input::Factory< SomeBase, double >::instance()->create("SomeDescendant", 0.1);
 @endcode
 * - through AbstractRecord::factory method. This possibility can be used if base class has defined
 *   AbstractRecord and its descendants contain Record derived from this AbstractRecord.
 *   Example for same constructor:
 @code
     AbstractRecord a_rec = record.val<AbstractRecord>("problem");
     SomeBase * sb = a_rec.factory< SomeBase, double>(0.25);
     // If arguments types can be deduced (by compiler) from actual arguments one can even use:
     SomeBase * sb = a_rec.factory< SomeBase >(0.25);
 @endcode
 *
 * For correct functionality must be used two macros defined in global_defs.h:
 * - FLOW123D_FORCE_LINK_IN_CHILD(x)
 * - FLOW123D_FORCE_LINK_IN_PARENT(x)
 * First is used in C source file of descendant class out of class methods, e.g.:
 *   FLOW123D_FORCE_LINK_IN_CHILD(gmsh)
 * Second is used in C source file of parent class in any of class method with same parameter as in
 * first used, e.g.:
 *   FLOW123D_FORCE_LINK_IN_PARENT(gmsh)
 *
