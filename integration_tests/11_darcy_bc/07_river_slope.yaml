  description: Steady flow with River boundary condition
  # The test problem use a square computational domain and emulate slope of the top surface
  # by prescribing boundary (hD) and switch pressure (hS) as linear functions, while
  # hD > hS to get physically relevant solution (no outflow for h<hS).
  # The solution can be visualized with Paraview using ref_output/flow_river_square.pvsm.
  # The "plot over line" near the top surface clearly displays three different parts of the
  # top boundary. On the left where h<hS, the slope of the solution is smaller due to the limited
  # inflow, for h>hS to slope is higher. For h>hD, the inflow turns into outflow which is visible on
  # the velocity field on the left.
  #
  # The inflow velocity is sigma*(bc_pressure - bc_switch_pressure) = 0.0004*0.3 = 1.2e-4
